        "Abstract": "After a 16-year hiatus, Russia has resumed its program of biomedical research in space, with the successful 30-day flight of the Bion-M 1 biosatellite (April 19\u2013May 19, 2013). The principal species for biomedical research in this project was the mouse. This paper presents an overview of the scientific goals, the experimental design and the mouse training/selection program. The aim of mice experiments in the Bion-M 1 project was to elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms, underlying the adaptation of key physiological systems to long-term exposure in microgravity. The studies with mice combined in vivo measurements, both in flight and post-flight (including continuous blood pressure measurement), with extensive in vitro studies carried out shortly after return of the mice and in the end of recovery study. Male C57/BL6 mice group housed in space habitats were flown aboard the Bion-M 1 biosatellite, or remained on ground in the control experiment that replicated environmental and housing conditions in the spacecraft. Vivarium control groups were used to account for housing effects and possible seasonal differences. Mice training included the co-adaptation in housing groups and mice adaptation to paste food diet. The measures taken to co-adapt aggressive male mice in housing groups and the peculiarities of \u201cspace\u201d paste food are described. The training program for mice designated for in vivo studies was broader and included behavioral/functional test battery and continuous behavioral measurements in the home-cage. The results of the preliminary tests were used for the selection of homogenous groups. After the flight, mice were in good condition for biomedical studies and displayed signs of pronounced disadaptation to Earth's gravity. The outcomes of the training program for the mice welfare are discussed. We conclude that our training program was effective and that male mice can be successfully employed in space biomedical research.",
        "Conclusion": "The Bion-M 1 flight was unique in many ways, particularly the unprecedented duration of an automated mission with living animals. The sex of the mice was male, thus imposing greater attention to creation and selection of stable groups of mice for social housing. The overall success was evident: aggressive interactions were noted on single occasions and under conditions of starvation only. The use of male animals is obviously required for research in male reproduction and their larger size compared to females offered clear advantages. Our program of mice training for flight and control experiments of the Bion-M 1 project was aimed to: ensure that mice adapt to stressful conditions of space flight when housed in groups; to collect baseline data from these mice; select homogenous groups; and, more generally, to promote collection of less variable data. The results of our program presented here demonstrate that group housed male mice need not be excluded a priori, but quite on the contrary, can be successfully employed in space biomedical research if clear and simple procedures provided by this study are followed. The failures in this project were connected with hardware malfunction in food distribution system and to microgravity-related changes in mouse behavior. Some of the injuries and deaths encountered in this pioneering effort suggest moving parts within the habitat present potential risks and should be avoided or carefully analyzed in the design of future mouse habitats. In this space experiment we have, for the first time, introduced implantable telemetry in these small laboratory animals. This shift to data collection during the flight became possible with the development of miniature implantable probes, thereby dramatically increasing the scientific output of such experiments. Moreover, the use of an automated data collection system during the post-flight stage of this experiment provided comprehensive data on the course and mechanism of recovery of varied physiological systems following exposure to microgravity. The unprecedented inclusion of daily video recordings proved valuable for scientific purposes, for animal welfare considerations, and for assessing both nominal and aberrant events. The good condition of spaceflight mice was the basis for the positive results of both the recovery and tissue sharing studies; leading us to conclude that our training program was generally effective. We express our hope that the results and considerations presented here will be useful for the planning of future missions and will help to ensure the welfare of rodents in space research.",

        "Overview": "This paper is essential reading for researchers in space biosciences as it outlines the successful methodology for preparing male mice for the unprecedented 30-day Bion-M 1 space mission. It details a critical training and selection program that effectively managed aggression in group-housed males, a significant hurdle in animal space research. The study provides a valuable blueprint for experimental design and animal welfare in long-duration spaceflight, addressing practical challenges like diet adaptation and in-flight monitoring, making it invaluable for planning future missions.",
        "Summary": "Background: After a 16-year break, Russia's Bion-M 1 mission aimed to study microgravity's effects on mice over 30 days. A primary challenge was managing the natural aggression of group-housed male mice and adapting them to spaceflight conditions to ensure their suitability for biomedical studies.\n\nMethods: Researchers implemented a thorough training program for male C57/BL6 mice. This involved co-adapting mice into stable groups to minimize aggression, transitioning them to a paste-based diet suitable for space, and selecting homogenous groups based on behavioral tests. For the first time in such a long mission, implantable telemetry devices were used for continuous in-flight physiological monitoring, supplemented by daily video recordings.\n\nResults: The training program proved highly successful. Aggressive behaviors were minimal, and the mice were in good health post-flight, showing clear signs of adaptation to microgravity. This validated them as suitable subjects for subsequent studies. The telemetry and video data provided significant scientific insights and aided in monitoring animal welfare, although hardware malfunctions with the food distribution system were noted.\n\nConclusions: The study concludes that with appropriate pre-flight training and selection, group-housed male mice are viable subjects for long-duration space biomedical research. The success of the mission's animal preparation program set a new standard for future experiments, while also highlighting the need for improved habitat hardware and the immense value of in-flight data collection technologies."

        "Abstract": "Bone is a dynamically remodeled tissue that requires gravity-mediated mechanical stimulation for maintenance of mineral content and structure. Homeostasis in bone occurs through a balance in the activities and signaling of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes, as well as proliferation and differentiation of their stem cell progenitors. Microgravity and unloading are known to cause osteoclast-mediated bone resorption; however, we hypothesize that osteocytic osteolysis, and cell cycle arrest during osteogenesis may also contribute to bone loss in space. To test this possibility, we exposed 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (n = 8) to microgravity for 15-days on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. Analysis of the pelvis by \u00b5CT shows decreases in bone volume fraction (BV/TV) of 6.29%, and bone thickness of 11.91%. TRAP-positive osteoclast-covered trabecular bone surfaces also increased in microgravity by 170% (p = 0.004), indicating osteoclastic bone degeneration. High-resolution X-ray nanoCT studies revealed signs of lacunar osteolysis, including increases in cross-sectional area (+17%, p = 0.022), perimeter (+14%, p = 0.008), and canalicular diameter (+6%, p = 0.037). Expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 1, 3, and 10 in bone, as measured by RT-qPCR, was also up-regulated in microgravity (+12.94, +2.98 and +16.85 fold respectively, p<0.01), with MMP10 localized to osteocytes, and consistent with induction of osteocytic osteolysis. Furthermore, expression of CDKN1a/p21 in bone increased 3.31 fold (p<0.01), and was localized to osteoblasts, possibly inhibiting the cell cycle during tissue regeneration as well as conferring apoptosis resistance to these cells. Finally the apoptosis inducer Trp53 was down-regulated by \u22121.54 fold (p<0.01), possibly associated with the quiescent survival-promoting function of CDKN1a/p21. In conclusion, our findings identify the pelvic and femoral region of the mouse skeleton as an active site of rapid bone loss in microgravity, and indicate that this loss is not limited to osteoclastic degradation. Therefore, this study offers new evidence for microgravity-induced osteocytic osteolysis, and CDKN1a/p21-mediated osteogenic cell cycle arrest.",
        "Conclusion": "In total, our findings demonstrate the pelvic-femoral musculo-skeletal complex as a highly load and gravity sensitive structure that can serve as a valuable model to study muscle and bone degeneration in space. Additionally, we demonstrate that bone responses to spaceflight are complex and involve osteoclastic, osteoblastic, and osteocytic degenerative responses. Finally, our findings on CDKN1a/p21 up-regulation in microgravity have the potential to become a major concern for tissue regenerative health in long-duration spaceflight. Future studies should address the specific molecular regulatory mechanisms of CDKN1a/p21 involvement in tissue degeneration during long-term spaceflight and the possibility of systemic activation of this strong molecular inhibitor of regenerative adult stem cell proliferation.",

        "Overview": "This study is crucial for understanding the multi-faceted mechanisms of bone loss in space. It moves beyond the known role of osteoclasts to reveal how microgravity also triggers osteocytic osteolysis (bone degradation by bone cells themselves) and halts the cell cycle of bone-forming osteoblasts. By identifying these additional pathways in mice on the STS-131 mission, the paper provides new, critical targets for developing countermeasures against space-induced osteoporosis and unloading-related bone loss on Earth.",
        "Summary": "Background: Bone homeostasis requires mechanical stimulation from gravity. While microgravity is known to cause bone resorption via osteoclasts, this study hypothesized that other mechanisms, such as osteocytic osteolysis and the arrest of bone-forming cell cycles, also contribute significantly to bone loss in space.\n\nMethods: Sixteen-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were exposed to microgravity for 15 days on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. Post-flight, their pelvic bones were analyzed using high-resolution \u00b5CT and nanoCT imaging, TRAP staining for osteoclast activity, and RT-qPCR to measure the expression of genes related to bone degradation and cell cycle regulation.\n\nResults: Microgravity exposure led to a 6.29% decrease in bone volume and a 11.91% decrease in bone thickness, with a 170% increase in osteoclast activity. Crucially, nanoCT revealed signs of osteocytic osteolysis, including enlarged lacunae and canaliculi. Gene expression analysis showed upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) consistent with this process, and a 3.31-fold increase in CDKN1a/p21, a cell cycle inhibitor localized to osteoblasts.\n\nConclusions: The study confirms that the pelvic-femoral region is highly sensitive to microgravity and serves as a valuable model for space-induced degeneration. It provides new evidence that bone loss in space is a complex process involving not only increased osteoclast activity but also osteocytic osteolysis and CDKN1a/p21-mediated inhibition of bone regeneration. The upregulation of CDKN1a/p21 is highlighted as a major potential concern for tissue health in long-duration spaceflight."

        "Abstract": "Microgravity, defined by minimal gravitational forces, represents a unique environment that profoundly influences biological systems, including human cells. This review examines the effects of microgravity on biological processes and their implications for human health. Microgravity significantly impacts the immune system by disrupting key mechanisms, such as T cell activation, cytokine production, and macrophage differentiation, leading to increased susceptibility to infections. In cancer biology, it promotes the formation of spheroids in cancer stem cells and thyroid cancer cells, which closely mimic in vivo tumor dynamics, providing novel insights for oncology research. Additionally, microgravity enhances tissue regeneration by modulating critical pathways, including Hippo and PI3K-Akt, thereby improving stem cell differentiation into hematopoietic and cardiomyocyte lineages. At the organ level, microgravity induces notable changes in hepatic metabolism, endothelial function, and bone mechanotransduction, contributing to lipid dysregulation, vascular remodeling, and accelerated bone loss. Notably, cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells and cultured under microgravity exhibit enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, improved calcium handling, and advanced structural maturation, including increased sarcomere length and nuclear eccentricity. These advancements enable the development of functional cardiomyocytes, presenting promising therapeutic opportunities for treating cardiac diseases, such as myocardial infarctions. These findings underscore the dual implications of microgravity for space medicine and terrestrial health. They highlight its potential to drive advances in regenerative therapies, oncology, and immunological interventions. Continued research into the biological effects of microgravity is essential for protecting astronaut health during prolonged space missions and fostering biomedical innovations with transformative applications on Earth.",

However, contemporary studies have indicated heterogeneity within adult stem-cell pools, and a novel culturing technique may address these limitations by selecting those for cell proliferation which are highly functional. Here, we report the preservation of stemness in human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) by using microgravity conditions combined with microspheres in a stirred suspension. The cells were bound to microspheres (100\u2212300 \u03bcm) and cultured using a wave-stirring shaker. One-week cultures using polystyrene and collagen microspheres increased the proportions of SSEA-3(+) hASCs 4.4- and 4.3-fold (2.7- and 2.9-fold increases in their numbers), respectively, compared to normal culture conditions. These cultured hASCs expressed higher levels of pluripotent markers (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, MYC, and KLF), and had improved abilities for proliferation, colony formation, network formation, and multiple-mesenchymal differentiation.

        "Abstract": "The International Space Station (ISS) National Laboratory is dedicated to studying the effects of space on life and physical systems, and to developing new science and technologies for space exploration. A key aspect of achieving these goals is to operate the ISS National Lab more like an Earth-based laboratory, conducting complex end-to-end experimentation, not limited to simple microgravity exposure. Towards that end NASA developed a novel suite of molecular biology laboratory tools, reagents, and methods, named WetLab-2, uniquely designed to operate in microgravity, and to process biological samples for real-time gene expression analysis on-orbit. This includes a novel fluidic RNA Sample Preparation Module and fluid transfer devices, all-in-one lyophilized PCR assays, centrifuge, and a real-time PCR thermal cycler. Here we describe the results from the WetLab-2 validation experiments conducted in microgravity during ISS increment 47/SPX-8. Specifically, quantitative PCR was performed on a concentration series of DNA calibration standards, and Reverse Transcriptase-quantitative PCR was conducted on RNA extracted and purified on-orbit from frozen Escherichia coli and mouse liver tissue. Cycle threshold (Ct) values and PCR efficiencies obtained on-orbit from DNA standards were similar to Earth (1 g) controls. Also, on-orbit multiplex analysis of gene expression from bacterial cells and mammalian tissue RNA samples was successfully conducted in about 3 h, with data transmitted within 2 h of experiment completion. Thermal cycling in microgravity resulted in the trapping of gas bubbles inside septa cap assay tubes, causing small but measurable increases in Ct curve noise and variability. Bubble formation was successfully suppressed in a rapid follow-up on-orbit experiment using standard caps to pressurize PCR tubes and reduce gas release during heating cycles. The WetLab-2 facility now provides a novel operational on-orbit research capability for molecular biology and demonstrates the feasibility of more complex wet bench experiments in the ISS National Lab environment.",

Cardiac deconditioning and atrophy on Earth are associated with altered Trp53 and oxidative stress-related pathways, but the effects of spaceflight on cardiac changes at the molecular level are less understood. We tested the hypothesis that spaceflight alters the expression of key genes related to stress response pathways, which may contribute to cardiovascular deconditioning during extended spaceflight. Mice were exposed to spaceflight for 15 days or maintained on Earth (ground control). Ventricle tissue was harvested starting ~3 h post-landing. We measured expression of select genes implicated in oxidative stress pathways and Trp53 signaling by quantitative PCR. Cardiac expression levels of 37 of 168 genes tested were altered after spaceflight. Spaceflight downregulated transcription factor, Nfe2l2 (Nrf2), upregulated Nox1 and downregulated Ptgs2, suggesting a persistent increase in oxidative stress-related target genes. Spaceflight also substantially upregulated Cdkn1a (p21) and cell cycle/apoptosis-related gene Myc, and downregulated the inflammatory response gene Tnf. There were no changes in apoptosis-related genes such as Trp53. Spaceflight altered the expression of genes regulating redox balance, cell cycle and senescence in cardiac tissue of mice. Thus, spaceflight may contribute to cardiac dysfunction due to oxidative stress.",

        "Overview": "This study provides crucial molecular insights into how spaceflight affects the heart, making it essential for understanding cardiovascular deconditioning in astronauts. By analyzing mouse heart tissue after 15 days in space, researchers identified that spaceflight alters key genes related to oxidative stress, cell cycle, and senescence. Specifically, the significant upregulation of Cdkn1a (p21) suggests a mechanism that could contribute to cardiac dysfunction, offering a potential target for countermeasures to protect heart health during long-duration missions.",
        "Summary": "Background: Spaceflight is known to cause cardiovascular changes, but the molecular underpinnings are not well understood. On Earth, similar cardiac deconditioning is linked to altered Trp53 and oxidative stress pathways. This study hypothesized that spaceflight similarly alters the expression of key stress response genes in the heart.\n\nMethods: Ventricle tissue was harvested from mice approximately 3 hours after they returned from a 15-day spaceflight mission. The expression of 168 select genes implicated in oxidative stress pathways and Trp53 signaling was measured using quantitative PCR and compared to ground control mice.\n\nResults: Spaceflight altered the expression of 37 of the 168 genes tested. Key findings include the downregulation of the transcription factor Nfe2l2 (Nrf2), which protects against oxidative stress, and the upregulation of Nox1, which generates oxidative stress. Most notably, spaceflight caused a substantial upregulation of Cdkn1a (p21), a gene linked to cell cycle arrest and senescence, and the cell cycle/apoptosis-related gene Myc. The inflammatory gene Tnf was downregulated.\n\nConclusions: The study concludes that spaceflight alters the expression of genes that regulate redox balance, cell cycle, and senescence in mouse cardiac tissue. These changes, particularly the persistent increase in oxidative stress-related genes and upregulation of p21, may contribute to cardiac dysfunction and deconditioning during extended space missions."

        "Abstract": "Space radiation may pose a risk to skeletal health during subsequent aging. Irradiation acutely stimulates bone remodeling in mice, although the long-term influence of space radiation on bone-forming potential (osteoblastogenesis) and possible adaptive mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that ionizing radiation impairs osteoblastogenesis in an ion-type specific manner, with low doses capable of modulating expression of redox-related genes. 16-weeks old, male, C57BL6/J mice were exposed to low linear-energy-transfer (LET) protons (150 MeV/n) or high-LET 56Fe ions (600 MeV/n) using either low (5 or 10 cGy) or high (50 or 200 cGy) doses at NASA\u2019s Space Radiation Lab. Five weeks or one year after irradiation, tissues were harvested and analyzed by microcomputed tomography for cancellous microarchitecture and cortical geometry. Marrow-derived, adherent cells were grown under osteoblastogenic culture conditions. Cell lysates were analyzed by RT-PCR during the proliferative or mineralizing phase of growth, and differentiation was analyzed by imaging mineralized nodules. As expected, a high dose (200 cGy), but not lower doses, of either 56Fe or protons caused a loss of cancellous bone volume/total volume. Marrow cells produced mineralized nodules ex vivo regardless of radiation type or dose; 56Fe (200 cGy) inhibited osteoblastogenesis by more than 90% (5 weeks and 1 year post-IR). After 5 weeks, irradiation (protons or 56Fe) caused few changes in gene expression levels during osteoblastogenesis, although a high dose 56Fe (200 cGy) increased Catalase and Gadd45. The addition of exogenous superoxide dismutase (SOD) protected marrow-derived osteoprogenitors from the damaging effects of exposure to low-LET (137Cs \u03b3) when irradiated in vitro, but had limited protective effects on high-LET 56Fe-exposed cells. In sum, either protons or 56Fe at a relatively high dose (200 cGy) caused persistent bone loss, whereas only high-LET 56Fe increased redox-related gene expression, albeit to a limited extent, and inhibited osteoblastogenesis. Doses below 50 cGy did not elicit widespread responses in any parameter measured. We conclude that high-LET irradiation at 200 cGy impaired osteoblastogenesis and regulated steady-state gene expression of select redox-related genes during osteoblastogenesis, which may contribute to persistent bone loss.",

        "Overview": "This paper is essential for assessing the long-term skeletal health risks for astronauts on deep-space missions. It investigates how different types of space-like radiation (protons vs. heavy ions) at various doses affect bone in mice. The study uniquely finds that only high-dose, high-LET heavy ions (56Fe) not only cause persistent bone loss but also impair the bone-forming potential of marrow cells. This suggests that the type of radiation is a critical factor in skeletal damage, providing vital information for developing targeted radiation countermeasures.",
        "Summary": "Background: Space radiation may pose a long-term risk to skeletal health. While radiation is known to acutely stimulate bone remodeling, its long-term impact on the potential of marrow cells to form new bone (osteoblastogenesis) and the specific effects of different ion types are not well understood.\n\nMethods: Male C57BL6/J mice were exposed to either low-LET protons or high-LET 56Fe ions at low (5-10 cGy) or high (50-200 cGy) doses. Tissues were harvested 5 weeks or 1 year post-irradiation. Bone microarchitecture was analyzed by microcomputed tomography. Marrow-derived cells were cultured to assess their ability to form mineralized bone nodules ex vivo, and gene expression was analyzed by RT-PCR.\n\nResults: As expected, only high doses (200 cGy) of both protons and 56Fe caused persistent loss of cancellous bone. However, only the high dose of high-LET 56Fe radiation significantly inhibited the ability of marrow cells to form bone (by over 90%), a defect that persisted for up to a year. This was accompanied by a limited increase in redox-related gene expression (Catalase, Gadd45). Doses below 50 cGy had no measurable effect on any parameter.\n\nConclusions: The study concludes that high-LET 56Fe irradiation at a dose of 200 cGy uniquely impairs osteoblastogenesis and alters the expression of select redox-related genes. This impairment in bone-forming potential may contribute to the persistent bone loss observed after exposure, highlighting that different types of space radiation have distinct long-term biological effects on the skeleton."

        "Abstract": "One potentially important bone quality characteristic is the response of bone to cyclic (repetitive) mechanical loading. In small animals, such as in rats and mice, cyclic loading experiments are particularly challenging to perform in a precise manner due to the small size of the bones and difficult-to-eliminate machine compliance. Addressing this issue, we developed a precise method for ex vivo cyclic compressive loading of isolated mouse vertebral bodies. The method has three key characteristics: 3D-printed support jigs for machining plano-parallel surfaces of the tiny vertebrae; pivotable loading platens to ensure uniform contact and loading of specimen surfaces; and specimen-specific micro-CT-based finite element analysis to measure stiffness to prescribe force levels that produce the same specified level of strain for all test specimens. To demonstrate utility, we measured fatigue life for three groups (n = 5\u20136 per group) of L5 vertebrae of C57BL/6J male mice, comparing our new method against two methods commonly used in the literature. We found reduced scatter of the mechanical behavior for this new method compared to the literature methods. In particular, for a controlled level of strain, the standard deviation of the measured fatigue life was up to 5-fold lower for the new method (F-ratio = 4.9; p < 0.01). The improved precision for this new method for biomechanical testing of small-animal vertebrae may help elucidate aspects of bone quality.",

        "Overview": "This study is highly valuable for researchers in bone mechanics and animal modeling, as it introduces a high-precision method for testing the fatigue life of small-animal vertebrae. Traditional methods suffer from imprecision due to the tiny size of mouse bones. This new technique, using 3D-printed jigs and specimen-specific analysis, reduces the variability in fatigue life measurements by up to five-fold. This improved precision is critical for accurately elucidating aspects of bone quality and the effects of diseases or treatments on the spine.",
        "Summary": "Background: Assessing bone quality involves understanding its response to repetitive (cyclic) loading, which can lead to fatigue failure. However, performing precise cyclic loading experiments on small animal bones, like mouse vertebrae, is challenging due to their size and the compliance of testing machines.\n\nMethods: The researchers developed a new method for ex vivo cyclic compressive loading of mouse vertebral bodies. The method incorporates three key innovations: 1) 3D-printed jigs to prepare the tiny vertebrae with perfectly parallel surfaces, 2) pivotable loading platens to ensure uniform force distribution, and 3) micro-CT-based finite element analysis for each specimen to prescribe forces that achieve a consistent level of strain across all samples.\n\nResults: To demonstrate the method's utility, the fatigue life of mouse vertebrae was measured and compared against two commonly used literature methods. The new method significantly reduced the scatter and variability of the results. The standard deviation of the measured fatigue life was up to 5-fold lower with the new technique, indicating much higher precision.\n\nConclusions: The improved precision of this novel method for biomechanical testing of small-animal vertebrae is a significant advancement. It may help researchers better elucidate important aspects of bone quality, such as fatigue resistance, which is crucial for understanding bone health and disease."

        "Abstract": "Bone can become brittle when exposed to ionizing radiation across a wide range of clinically relevant doses that span from radiotherapy (accumulative 50 Gy) to sterilization (~35,000 Gy). While irradiation-induced embrittlement has been attributed to changes in the collagen molecular structure, the relative role of collagen fragmentation versus non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking remains unclear. To better understand the effects of radiation on the bone material without cellular activity, we conducted an ex vivo x-ray radiation experiment on excised mouse lumbar vertebrae. Spinal tissue from twenty-week old, female, C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to a single x-ray radiation dose of either 0 (control), 50, 1,000, 17,000, or 35,000 Gy. Measurements were made for collagen fragmentation, non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking, and both monotonic and cyclic-loading compressive mechanical properties. We found that the group differences for mechanical properties were more consistent with those for collagen fragmentation than for non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking. Monotonic strength at 17,000 and 35,000 Gy was lower than that of the control by 50% and 73% respectively, (p < 0.001) but at 50 and 1,000 Gy was not different than the control. Consistent with those trends, collagen fragmentation only occurred at 17,000 and 35,000 Gy. By contrast, non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking was greater than control for all radiation doses (p < 0.001). All results were consistent both for monotonic and cyclic loading conditions. We conclude that the reductions in bone compressive monotonic strength and fatigue life due to ex vivo ionizing radiation are more likely caused by fragmentation of the collagen backbone than any increases in non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks.",

        "Overview": "This research provides a clear and important answer to a long-standing question in radiobiology and orthopedics: what causes bone to become brittle after radiation exposure? By irradiating excised mouse vertebrae, this study separates the material effects from cellular responses. It decisively shows that at high doses, it is the fragmentation of the collagen backbone, not the formation of non-enzymatic crosslinks, that leads to a dramatic loss of bone strength and fatigue life. This finding is critical for understanding radiation damage and improving bone graft sterilization techniques.",
        "Summary": "Background: Ionizing radiation, used in radiotherapy and for sterilizing bone grafts, is known to make bone brittle. This embrittlement has been linked to changes in collagen, but it was unclear whether the primary cause was collagen fragmentation or the formation of non-enzymatic crosslinks.\n\nMethods: Excised mouse lumbar vertebrae were subjected to a range of X-ray radiation doses (0, 50, 1,000, 17,000, or 35,000 Gy) to study the effects on the bone material itself, without cellular activity. Researchers then measured collagen fragmentation, non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking, and the bone's mechanical properties under both monotonic (single-load) and cyclic (fatigue) compression.\n\nResults: Monotonic strength was reduced by 50% and 73% at 17,000 and 35,000 Gy, respectively, but was unaffected at lower doses. This trend was consistent with collagen fragmentation, which only occurred at the two highest doses. In contrast, non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking increased at all radiation doses, even those that did not affect strength. The results were consistent for both monotonic strength and fatigue life.\n\nConclusions: The study concludes that reductions in bone's compressive strength and fatigue life from high-dose ex vivo ionizing radiation are more likely caused by the fragmentation of the collagen backbone than by an increase in non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks. This clarifies the primary mechanism of material degradation in irradiated bone."

        "Abstract": "BackgroundThe dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) is located at the sarcolemma of muscle fibers, providing structural integrity. Mutations in and loss of DGC proteins cause a spectrum of muscular dystrophies. When only the sarcoglycan subcomplex is absent, muscles display severe myofiber degeneration, but little susceptibility to contractile damage, suggesting that disease occurs not by structural deficits but through aberrant signaling, namely, loss of normal mechanotransduction signaling through the sarcoglycan complex. We extended our previous studies on mechanosensitive, \u03b3-sarcoglycan-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation, to determine whether additional pathways are altered with the loss of \u03b3-sarcoglycan. MethodsWe examined mechanotransduction in the presence and absence of \u03b3-sarcoglycan, using C2C12 myotubes, and primary cultures and isolated muscles from C57Bl/6 (C57) and \u03b3-sarcoglycan-null (\u03b3-SG-/-) mice. All were subjected to cyclic passive stretch. Signaling protein phosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting of lysates from stretched and non-stretched samples. Calcium dependence was assessed by maintaining muscles in calcium-free or tetracaine-supplemented Ringer\u2019s solution. Dependence on mTOR was determined by stretching isolated muscles in the presence or absence of rapamycin. ResultsC2C12 myotube stretch caused a robust increase in P-p70S6K, but decreased P-FAK and P-ERK2. Neither Akt nor ERK1 were responsive to passive stretch. Similar but non-significant trends were observed in C57 primary cultures in response to stretch, and \u03b3-SG-/- cultures displayed no p70S6K response. In contrast, in isolated muscles, p70S6K was mechanically responsive. Basal p70S6K activation was elevated in muscles of \u03b3-SG-/- mice, in a calcium-independent manner. p70S6K activation increased with stretch in both C57 and \u03b3-SG-/- isolated muscles, and was sustained in \u03b3-SG-/- muscles, unlike the transient response in C57 muscles. Rapamycin treatment blocked all of p70S6K activation in stretched C57 muscles, and reduced downstream S6RP phosphorylation. However, even though rapamycin treatment decreased p70S6K activation in stretched \u03b3-SG-/- muscles, S6RP phosphorylation remained elevated. Conclusionsp70S6K is an important component of \u03b3-sarcoglycan-dependent mechanotransduction in skeletal muscle. Our results suggest that loss of \u03b3-sarcoglycan uncouples the response of p70S6K to stretch and implies that \u03b3-sarcoglycan is important for inactivation of this pathway. Overall, we assert that altered load-sensing mechanisms exist in muscular dystrophies where the sarcoglycans are absent.",
        "Conclusion": "We have identified p70S6K as part of a novel SG-dependent mechanosensitive signaling pathway in skeletal muscle. Our results suggest that \u03b3-SG is required for the inactivation of p70S6K following its activation in response to mechanical stimulation. These studies provide new insights into the normal function of the SG complex, and the mechanisms by which its deficiency in some forms of muscular dystrophy may contribute to pathology.",

        "Summary": "Background: The dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) provides structural integrity to muscle fibers. The absence of the sarcoglycan (SG) subcomplex within the DGC causes severe muscular dystrophy, believed to result from aberrant signaling rather than structural failure. This study investigated how the loss of \u03b3-sarcoglycan affects mechanosensitive signaling pathways in muscle.\n\nMethods: The study used C2C12 myotubes, primary muscle cultures, and isolated muscles from both normal (C57) and \u03b3-sarcoglycan-null (\u03b3-SG-/-) mice. These samples were subjected to cyclic passive stretch. The phosphorylation (activation) of various signaling proteins, including p70S6K, was measured by immunoblotting. The roles of calcium and the mTOR pathway were assessed using inhibitors.\n\nResults: Passive stretch activated p70S6K in normal muscle cells and tissues. In isolated muscles from \u03b3-SG-/- mice, the basal activation of p70S6K was already elevated. While stretch further increased p70S6K activation in both genotypes, the response was sustained in \u03b3-SG-/- muscles, unlike the transient response in normal muscles. Furthermore, downstream signaling from p70S6K remained elevated in stretched \u03b3-SG-/- muscles even when the mTOR pathway was blocked with rapamycin.\n\nConclusions: The study identifies p70S6K as a key part of a novel \u03b3-sarcoglycan-dependent mechanosensitive signaling pathway. The results suggest that \u03b3-sarcoglycan is crucial for the proper inactivation of this pathway following mechanical stimulation. Its absence leads to an uncoupled and sustained activation, which may contribute to the pathology of muscular dystrophies where sarcoglycans are deficient."

Many Rab-like proteins exist in plants, but only a subset have been functionally characterized. ResultsHere we report that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c play important roles in pollen development, germination and tube elongation. AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants have no obvious morphological changes compared with wild-type plants across a variety of growth conditions. An AtrabD2b/2c double mutant is also indistinguishable from wild-type plants during vegetative growth; however its siliques are shorter than those in wild-type plants. Compared with wild-type plants, AtrabD2b/2c mutants produce deformed pollen with swollen and branched pollen tube tips. The shorter siliques in the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant were found to be primarily due to the pollen defects. AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c have different but overlapping expression patterns, and they are both highly expressed in pollen. Both AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c protein localize to Golgi bodies.

By studying mutant Arabidopsis plants, the authors demonstrate that while the loss of one protein has no effect, the loss of both leads to deformed pollen and defective pollen tube growth, resulting in reduced fertility. This study clarifies the function of these Golgi-localized Rab GTPases in vesicle trafficking, a fundamental process for plant reproduction.",
        "Summary": "Background: Rab GTPases are key regulators of vesicle trafficking (exocytosis, endocytosis) in cells. While many Rab-like proteins exist in plants, the specific functions of most are unknown. This study aimed to characterize the roles of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c in Arabidopsis.\n\nMethods: The researchers created and analyzed single and double knockout mutants for the AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c genes. They observed the plants' vegetative growth, reproductive success (silique length), and pollen morphology. Protein localization was determined, and expression patterns were analyzed to understand where the proteins function.\n\nResults: Single mutants for either gene showed no obvious defects. However, the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant, while appearing normal during vegetative growth, had shorter siliques (seed pods). This was found to be due to pollen defects; the double mutant produced deformed pollen that resulted in swollen and branched pollen tubes, hindering fertilization. Both proteins were found to be localized to the Golgi apparatus and were highly expressed in pollen.\n\nConclusions: The findings support a partially redundant role for AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c in the vesicle trafficking required for proper pollen development and pollen tube growth. The loss of both proteins disrupts this process in a way that other members of the AtRabD family cannot compensate for, highlighting their specific importance in plant reproduction."

        "Abstract": "The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor SYP41 is involved in vesicle fusion at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and interacts with AtVPS45, SYP61, and VTI12. These proteins are involved in diverse cellular processes, including vacuole biogenesis and stress tolerance. A previously uncharacterized protein, named TNO1 (for TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein), was identified by coimmunoprecipitation as a SYP41-interacting protein. TNO1 was found to localize to the TGN by immunofluorescence microscopy. A tno1 mutant showed increased sensitivity to high concentrations of NaCl, KCl, and LiCl and also to mannitol-induced osmotic stress. Localization of SYP61, which is involved in the salt stress response, was disrupted in the tno1 mutant. Vacuolar proteins were partially secreted to the apoplast in the tno1 mutant, suggesting that TNO1 is required for efficient protein trafficking to the vacuole. The tno1 mutant had delayed formation of the brefeldin A (BFA) compartment in cotyledons upon application of BFA, suggesting less efficient membrane fusion processes in the mutant. Unlike most TGN proteins, TNO1 does not relocate to the BFA compartment upon BFA treatment. These data demonstrate that TNO1 is involved in vacuolar trafficking and salt tolerance, potentially via roles in vesicle fusion and in maintaining TGN structure or identity.",

Researchers found that TNO1 interacts with the vesicle fusion machinery at the trans-Golgi Network (TGN) in Arabidopsis.

This work provides new insights into how the TGN maintains its structure and function to support essential processes like nutrient storage and stress response in plants.",
        "Summary": "Background: In plant cells, the trans-Golgi network (TGN) is a central hub for sorting and transporting proteins. The protein SYP41 is involved in vesicle fusion at the TGN and is linked to vacuole formation and stress tolerance. This study aimed to identify and characterize new proteins that interact with SYP41.\n\nMethods: Researchers used coimmunoprecipitation to identify proteins that bind to SYP41 and discovered a new protein they named TNO1. They determined its location in the cell using immunofluorescence microscopy. A tno1 knockout mutant was created and tested for its sensitivity to high salt (NaCl, KCl, LiCl) and osmotic stress (mannitol). Vacuolar protein trafficking and the effects of the drug Brefeldin A (BFA), which disrupts the TGN, were also examined.\n\nResults: TNO1 was found to be localized to the TGN. The tno1 mutant showed increased sensitivity to both salt and osmotic stress. In the mutant, vacuolar proteins were incorrectly secreted outside the cell, indicating a defect in vacuolar trafficking. The formation of the Brefeldin A compartment was delayed, suggesting less efficient membrane fusion. Interestingly, TNO1 itself did not relocate to the BFA compartment, unlike most other TGN proteins.\n\nConclusions: The study demonstrates that TNO1 is a TGN-localized protein involved in both vacuolar trafficking and salt tolerance in Arabidopsis. It may function by participating in vesicle fusion processes and helping to maintain the structure or identity of the TGN."

AtGTLP is a membrane-anchored protein, which exhibits a type II-like topology, with a single transmembrane helix and a globular domain in the C-terminal part of its amino acid sequence. Colocalization data we collected suggest that AtGTLP should localize mainly to Golgi apparatus, especially to certain zones of trans-Golgi.

Directional growth of roots occurs by a combination of sensing external cues, hormonal signaling and cytoskeletal changes in the root cells. Roots growing on slanted, impenetrable growth medium display a characteristic waving and skewing, and mutants with deviations in these phenotypes assist in identifying genes required for root movement. Our study identifies a role for a trans-Golgi network-localized protein in root skewing. ResultsWe found that Arabidopsis thaliana TNO1 (TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein), a putative tethering factor localized at the trans-Golgi network, affects root skewing. tno1 knockout mutants display enhanced root skewing and epidermal cell file rotation. Skewing of tno1 roots increases upon microtubule stabilization, but is insensitive to microtubule destabilization. Microtubule destabilization leads to severe defects in cell morphology in tno1 seedlings. Microtubule array orientation is unaffected in the mutant roots, suggesting that the increase in cell file rotation is independent of the orientation of microtubule arrays. ConclusionsWe conclude that TNO1 modulates root skewing in a mechanism that is dependent on microtubules but is not linked to disruption of the orientation of microtubule arrays.

Auxin asymmetry at the tips of elongating stage II lateral roots was reduced in the tno1 mutant, suggesting a role for TNO1 in cellular auxin transport during lateral root emergence. During gravistimulation, tno1 roots exhibited delayed auxin transport from the columella to the basal epidermal cells. Endocytosis to the TGN was unaffected in the mutant, indicating that bulk endocytic defects are not responsible for the observed phenotypes.

They measured the timing of lateral root emergence, the gravitropic bending of roots, and the plant's sensitivity to natural and synthetic auxins. Auxin distribution in lateral root tips was visualized, and auxin transport during a gravity stimulus was assessed. Endocytosis was also measured to rule out general defects in this process.\n\nResults: The tno1 mutant exhibited delayed lateral root emergence, decreased gravitropic bending in roots, and increased sensitivity to auxin. During lateral root development and gravistimulation, the normal asymmetric distribution of auxin was disrupted in the mutant roots. However, general endocytosis to the TGN was found to be unaffected.\n\nConclusions: The study demonstrates that TNO1 plays a role in mediating auxin-dependent responses, including lateral root development and gravitropism. The defects observed in the tno1 mutant are likely caused by impaired trafficking of auxin transport proteins, rather than a general endocytic defect, highlighting the importance of the TGN in regulating plant growth."

Here, we characterize the presumed Drosophila ortholog of the mammalian SUN protein, sperm-associated antigen 4 (Spag4, previously named Giacomo), and demonstrate that Spag4 is required for centriole and nuclear attachment during spermatogenesis. Production of spag4 mRNA is limited to the testis, and Spag4 protein shows a dynamic pattern of association with the germline nuclei, including a concentration of protein at the site of attachment of the single spermatid centriole. In the absence of Spag4, nuclei and centrioles or basal bodies (BBs) dissociate from each other after meiosis. This role of Spag4 in centriolar attachment does not involve either of the two KASH proteins of the Drosophila genome (Klarsicht and MSP-300), but does require the coiled-coil protein Yuri Gagarin. Yuri shows an identical pattern of localization at the nuclear surface to Spag4 during spermatogenesis, and epistasis studies show that the activities of Yuri and dynein-dynactin are downstream of spag4 in this centriole attachment pathway. The later defects in spermatogenesis seen for yuri and spag4 mutants are similar, suggesting they could be secondary to initial disruption of events at the nuclear surface.",

        "Overview": "This paper identifies a crucial molecular partnership required for male fertility in Drosophila, providing key insights into the mechanics of sperm development. Researchers demonstrate that the SUN protein Spag4 and the coiled-coil protein Yuri Gagarin work together to anchor the centriole (which becomes the sperm's basal body) to the nucleus during spermatogenesis. The study clarifies that this essential connection is independent of the known KASH proteins, revealing a novel pathway for maintaining nuclear-centrosomal proximity in a vital cellular process.",
        "Summary": "Background: The attachment of centrosomes to the nucleus is a critical process in many cells, often mediated by LINC complexes composed of SUN and KASH proteins. This study investigated this process during sperm development (spermatogenesis) in the fruit fly, Drosophila.\n\nMethods: The researchers characterized the Drosophila ortholog of the mammalian SUN protein Spag4. They analyzed its expression pattern and localization within the testis. They created spag4 mutant flies and observed the effects on the attachment of centrioles and basal bodies (BBs) to the nucleus after meiosis. The involvement of known KASH proteins (Klarsicht, MSP-300) and the protein Yuri Gagarin was investigated through genetic and localization studies.\n\nResults: Spag4 protein was found to be concentrated at the site where the spermatid centriole attaches to the nucleus. In the absence of Spag4, the nuclei and centrioles/basal bodies dissociated from each other after meiosis. This function did not require the known Drosophila KASH proteins. Instead, it required the protein Yuri Gagarin, which showed an identical localization pattern to Spag4. Further experiments suggested that Yuri Gagarin acts downstream of Spag4 in this centriole attachment pathway.\n\nConclusions: The abstract suggests that the Drosophila SUN protein Spag4 cooperates with the coiled-coil protein Yuri Gagarin in a novel pathway to maintain the crucial connection between the basal body and the nucleus during sperm development. The similar defects seen in both yuri and spag4 mutants indicate they function together, with the later-stage problems in spermatogenesis likely being a secondary consequence of the initial failure of this attachment."

        "Abstract": "Space travel presents unlimited opportunities for exploration and discovery, but requires better understanding of the biological consequences of long-term exposure to spaceflight. Immune function in particular is relevant for space travel. Human immune responses are weakened in space, with increased vulnerability to opportunistic infections and immune-related conditions. In addition, microorganisms can become more virulent in space, causing further challenges to health. To understand these issues better and to contribute to design of effective countermeasures, we used the Drosophila model of innate immunity to study immune responses in both hypergravity and spaceflight. Focusing on infections mediated through the conserved Toll and Imd signaling pathways, we found that hypergravity improves resistance to Toll-mediated fungal infections except in a known gravitaxis mutant of the yuri gagarin gene. These results led to the first spaceflight project on Drosophila immunity, in which flies that developed to adulthood in microgravity were assessed for immune responses by transcription profiling on return to Earth. Spaceflight alone altered transcription, producing activation of the heat shock stress system. Space flies subsequently infected by fungus failed to activate the Toll pathway. In contrast, bacterial infection produced normal activation of the Imd pathway. We speculate on possible linkage between functional Toll signaling and the heat shock chaperone system. Our major findings are that hypergravity and spaceflight have opposing effects, and that spaceflight produces stress-related transcriptional responses and results in a specific inability to mount a Toll-mediated infection response.",

        "Overview": "This study provides compelling evidence that altered gravity environments directly impact the innate immune system, making it a critical read for space medicine. Using the Drosophila model, researchers found that hypergravity enhances resistance to fungal infections, while spaceflight has the opposite effect. Most notably, flies that developed in microgravity were unable to activate the conserved Toll signaling pathway to fight fungal infection upon return to Earth. This specific impairment highlights a key vulnerability that could affect astronaut health on long-duration missions.",
        "Summary": "Background: Human immune responses are known to be weakened in space, increasing vulnerability to infections. To better understand the biological mechanisms, this study used the fruit fly, Drosophila, as a model for innate immunity to investigate immune responses in both hypergravity and spaceflight.\n\nMethods: The study focused on the conserved Toll and Imd immune signaling pathways. Flies were subjected to hypergravity and their resistance to Toll-mediated fungal infections was measured. In a separate spaceflight experiment, flies developed to adulthood in microgravity on the ISS. Upon their return to Earth, their immune responses were assessed by transcription profiling after being infected with either fungus (to test the Toll pathway) or bacteria (to test the Imd pathway).\n\nResults: Hypergravity improved resistance to fungal infections, an effect that was absent in a gravitaxis mutant. Conversely, spaceflight had a detrimental effect. Flies that developed in microgravity showed activation of heat shock stress genes. When these space-flown flies were subsequently infected with a fungus, they failed to activate the Toll pathway. In contrast, their response to bacterial infection via the Imd pathway was normal.\n\nConclusions: The study's major findings are that hypergravity and spaceflight have opposing effects on the Drosophila immune system. Spaceflight induces stress-related transcriptional changes and specifically impairs the ability to mount a Toll-mediated immune response against fungal infection, while leaving the Imd pathway intact."

By integrating multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, etc.), the study establishes that altered lipid metabolism is a recurring theme in response to spaceflight.

        "Abstract": "Space radiation has recently been considered a risk factor for astronauts\u2019 cardiac health. As an example, for the case of how to query and identify datasets within NASA\u2019s GeneLab database and demonstrate the database utility, we used an unbiased systems biology method for identifying key genes/drivers for the contribution of space radiation on the cardiovascular system. This knowledge can contribute to designing appropriate experiments targeting these specific pathways. Microarray data from cardiomyocytes of male C57BL/6 mice followed-up for 28 days after exposure to 900 mGy of 1 GeV proton or 150 mGy of 1 GeV/n 56Fe were compared to human endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured for 7 days on the International Space Station (ISS). We observed common molecular pathways between simulated space radiation and HUVECs flown on the ISS. The analysis suggests FYN is the central driver/hub for the cardiovascular response to space radiation: the known oxidative stress induced immediately following radiation would only be transient and would upregulate FYN, which in turn would reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, protecting the cardiovascular system. The transcriptomic signature of exposure to protons was also much closer to the spaceflight signature than 56Fe\u2019s signature. To our knowledge, this is the first time GeneLab datasets were utilized to provide potential biological indications that the majority of ions on the ISS are protons, clearly illustrating the power of omics analysis. More generally, this work also demonstrates how to combine animal radiation studies done on the ground and spaceflight studies to evaluate human risk in space.",

This study used an unbiased systems biology approach on datasets from NASA's GeneLab database to identify key genes and pathways involved in the cardiovascular response to space radiation, which could guide future experiments.\n\nMethods: Researchers compared microarray data from two distinct experiments in the GeneLab database. The first involved cardiomyocytes from mice exposed to either proton or 56Fe radiation on the ground. The second involved human endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured for 7 days on the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nResults: The analysis revealed common molecular pathways between the radiation-exposed mouse cells and the space-flown human cells. The gene FYN was identified as a central hub or driver for the cardiovascular response to space radiation. The proposed mechanism is that radiation-induced oxidative stress upregulates FYN, which in turn reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS), acting as a protective mechanism. Interestingly, the gene expression signature from proton radiation was much more similar to the actual spaceflight signature than that from 56Fe radiation.\n\nConclusions: The study demonstrates how GeneLab datasets can be used to generate novel hypotheses, such as the central role of FYN in the cardiovascular response to space radiation. The similarity between proton radiation and spaceflight signatures provides potential biological evidence that protons are a major component of the radiation environment on the ISS, illustrating the power of this type of omics analysis."

The International Space Station (ISS) is ideal for investigating microbial diversity and virulence associated with spaceflight. The shotgun metagenomics data of the ISS generated during the Microbial Tracking\u20131 (MT-1) project and resulting metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) across three flights in eight different locations during 12 months were used in this study. The objective of this study was to identify the AMR genes associated with whole genomes of 226 cultivable strains, 21 shotgun metagenome sequences, and 24 MAGs retrieved from the ISS environmental samples that were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA; viable microbes). ResultsWe have analyzed the data using a deep learning model, allowing us to go beyond traditional cut-offs based only on high DNA sequence similarity and extending the catalog of AMR genes. Our results in PMA treated samples revealed AMR dominance in the last flight for Kalamiella piersonii, a bacteria related to urinary tract infection in humans. The analysis of 226 pure strains isolated from the MT-1 project revealed hundreds of antibiotic resistance genes from many isolates, including two top-ranking species that corresponded to strains of Enterobacter bugandensis and Bacillus cereus. Computational predictions were experimentally validated by antibiotic resistance profiles in these two species, showing a high degree of concordance. Specifically, disc assay data confirmed the high resistance of these two pathogens to various beta-lactam antibiotics. ConclusionOverall, our computational predictions and validation analyses demonstrate the advantages of machine learning to uncover concealed AMR determinants in metagenomics datasets, expanding the understanding of the ISS environmental microbiomes and their pathogenic potential in humans.

Terrestrially, women have a higher incidence of radiation-induced cancers, largely driven by lung, thyroid, breast, and ovarian cancers, and therefore, historically, they have been permitted to spend significantly less time in space than men. In the present review, we focus on the effects of microgravity and radiation on the female reproductive system, particularly gynecological cancer. The aim is to provide a summary of the research that has been carried out related to the risk of gynecological cancer, highlighting what further studies are needed to pave the way for safer exploration class missions, as well as postflight screening and management of women astronauts following long-duration spaceflight.",

        "Summary": "Background: Outer space is a hostile environment, with ionizing radiation and microgravity posing significant health risks to astronauts. Women are known to have a higher terrestrial incidence of radiation-induced cancers, particularly in reproductive tissues, but the specific risk of gynecological cancer in space is not well understood.\n\nMethods: This paper is a review of existing research. The authors summarize studies on the effects of microgravity and radiation on the female reproductive system and on established cancer hallmarks. The focus is on how these spaceflight stressors might increase the risk of developing gynecological cancers, such as ovarian cancer.\n\nResults: The review consolidates evidence showing that spaceflight conditions can impact biological processes that are hallmarks of cancer. It highlights that women have historically been permitted less time in space due to concerns over higher radiation-induced cancer risk, driven largely by cancers of the breast, thyroid, and reproductive organs.\n\nConclusions: The paper emphasizes the need for further research into the risk of gynecological cancer for female astronauts. It calls for studies that can inform the development of safer exploration missions, as well as better post-flight screening and health management strategies for women who have completed long-duration spaceflights."

We compared the transcriptome response of liver and quadriceps from mice on NASA RR1 mission, after 37 days of exposure to spaceflight using GSEA, ORA, and sparse partial least square-differential analysis. We found that lipid metabolism is the most affected biological process between the two organs. A specific gene cluster expression pattern in the liver strongly correlated with glucose sparing and an energy-saving response affecting high energy demand process gene expression such as DNA repair, autophagy, and translation in the muscle.

By comparing the transcriptomes of liver and quadriceps from mice on a 37-day space mission, researchers discovered a strong correlation between impaired lipid metabolism in the liver and an energy-saving response in the muscle.

        "Summary": "Background: The physiological risks of spaceflight, including muscle atrophy and liver changes, are major hurdles for human space exploration. The relationship between how these two organs respond to space exposure, however, has not been studied.\n\nMethods: Researchers compared the transcriptome (gene expression) response of liver and quadriceps muscle tissue from mice flown on the NASA RR1 mission for 37 days. They used several bioinformatics techniques, including Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and sparse partial least square-differential analysis (sPLS-DA), to identify affected biological processes and correlations between the two tissues.\n\nResults: Lipid metabolism was identified as the most affected biological process connecting the two organs. A specific pattern of gene expression in the liver was found to be strongly correlated with a glucose-sparing and energy-saving response in the muscle. This muscle response involved the downregulation of genes for high-energy processes like DNA repair, autophagy, and translation.\n\nConclusions: The study concludes that impaired lipid metabolism gene expression in the liver and the gene expression signature of muscle atrophy are paired events during spaceflight. This finding suggests a metabolic crosstalk between the liver and muscle, and implies that dietary changes could be a viable countermeasure to address these issues."

        "Abstract": "Despite surging interest in space travel in recent decades, the impacts of prolonged, elevated exposure to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) on human health remain poorly understood. This form of ionizing radiation causes significant changes to biological systems including damage to DNA structure by altering epigenetic phenotype with emphasis on DNA methylation. Building on previous work by Kennedy et al. (Sci Rep 8(1): 6709. 10.1038/S41598-018-24755-8), we evaluated spatial DNA methylation patterns triggered by high-LET (56Fe, 28Si) and low-LET (X-ray) radiation and the influence of chromosome positioning and epigenetic architecture in distinct radial layers of cell nucleus. Next, we validated our results using gene expression data of mice irradiated with simulated GCR and JAXA astronauts. We showed that primarily 56Fe induces a persistent DNA methylation increase whereas 28Si and X-ray induce a decrease DNA methylation which is not persistent with time. Moreover, we highlighted the role of nuclear chromatin architecture in cell response to external radiation. In summary, our study provides novel insights towards epigenetic and transcriptomic response as well as chromatin multidimensional structure influence on galactic cosmic radiation damage.",

        "Overview": "This research offers crucial insights into how space radiation damages our DNA, highlighting the importance of both radiation type and the 3D organization of our genome. By comparing different radiation types, the study found that high-LET radiation like iron (56Fe) causes a persistent increase in DNA methylation, while other types cause a transient decrease. Significantly, the work reveals that the location of genes within the nucleus influences their susceptibility, providing a new dimension to understanding and mitigating the long-term health risks of galactic cosmic radiation.",
        "Summary": "Background: The impact of prolonged exposure to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) on human health, particularly its effect on DNA structure via epigenetic changes like DNA methylation, is poorly understood. This study builds on previous work to evaluate how radiation type and the spatial organization of the genome affect these changes.\n\nMethods: The study evaluated spatial DNA methylation patterns in cells exposed to high-LET (56Fe, 28Si) and low-LET (X-ray) radiation. It examined the influence of chromosome positioning and epigenetic architecture within different radial layers of the cell nucleus. The findings were then validated using gene expression data from mice irradiated with simulated GCR and from JAXA astronauts.\n\nResults: The results showed that different radiation types have distinct and lasting effects. High-LET 56Fe radiation induced a persistent increase in DNA methylation, whereas 28Si and X-rays induced a decrease in DNA methylation that was not persistent over time. The study also highlighted that the 3D architecture of chromatin within the nucleus plays a significant role in the cell's response to radiation.\n\nConclusions: The study provides novel insights into the epigenetic and transcriptomic responses to GCR. It demonstrates that the type of radiation dictates the nature and persistence of DNA methylation changes and, importantly, that the multidimensional structure of chromatin influences how the cell responds to this damage."

These alterations encompass genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased inflammation, homeostatic dysregulation, and various epigenomic changes. Remarkably, these changes bear similarities to those observed during the aging process on Earth. However, our understanding of the connection between these molecular shifts and disease development in space remains limited. Frailty syndrome, a clinical syndrome associated with biological aging, has not been comprehensively investigated during spaceflight.

Our objective was to assess the presence of biological markers and pathways related to frailty, aging, and sarcopenia within the spaceflight context. Through our analysis, we identified notable changes in gene expression patterns that may be indicative of the development of a frailty-like condition during space missions.

        "Summary": "Background: Previous research identified a specific microRNA signature associated with spaceflight that could be used as a biomarker. This study expands on that work to determine the biological pathways that are rescued by a countermeasure treatment targeting these microRNAs.\n\nMethods: Researchers used 3D microvessel cell cultures exposed to simulated deep space radiation (0.5 Gy of Galactic Cosmic Radiation). Some cultures were treated with antagomirs\u2014inhibitors for three specific microRNAs (miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p). RNA-sequencing and transcriptomic analysis were performed to identify changes in gene expression and biological pathways. The relevance of these findings to humans was confirmed by analyzing data from astronauts on the NASA Twin Study, Inspiration4, and JAXA missions.\n\nResults: The antagomir treatment was effective at a cellular level. It led to a significant reduction in inflammation and DNA double-strand break activity. Furthermore, the treatment rescued mitochondrial functions that were impaired by the radiation exposure. Analysis of astronaut data confirmed that the genes and pathways affected by the antagomirs are also altered in humans during spaceflight.\n\nConclusions: The findings indicate that targeting specific spaceflight-associated microRNAs with an antagomir treatment is a viable countermeasure strategy. This approach could potentially be used by astronauts during space missions to mitigate the cellular damage caused by space radiation."

        "Abstract": "Mounting ambitions and capabilities for public and private, non-government sector crewed space exploration bring with them an increasingly diverse set of space travelers, raising new and nontrivial ethical, legal, and medical policy and practice concerns which are still relatively underexplored. In this piece, we lay out several pressing issues related to ethical considerations for selecting space travelers and conducting human subject research on them, especially in the context of non-governmental and commercial/private space operations.",
        "Conclusion": "We are entering an exciting new era of space exploration previously only thought of as science fiction. Commercial/private and civilian spaceflights, such as Inspiration4 and the Polaris missions are no longer just a possibility but a reality. Exciting as these opportunities are, they also come with the burden of ensuring that future space travel will be as safe and ethical as possible. While governmental oversight has historically governed space activities, the emergence of non-governmental initiatives calls for unified ethical guidelines, safeguarding human well-being during selection, research, and decision-making in space. Since non-governmental outfits are not bound by the same rules in the same way, we as a community must ensure that the guidelines we set will guide space exploration according to the highest ethical and medical standards for humans that are currently possible, including selection of SOs, medical research ranging from human subject research to discussion of in-flight triage decisions. The added difficulties of non-universal terminology referring to different kinds of space travelers and of making guidelines sensitive to the diversity and variety of potential spaceflight endeavors will add further layers of complexity. The earlier and better any such guidelines can be implemented, the better the chances that space travel can be performed according to the safest and most optimal standards.",

        "Summary": "Background: The rapid growth of non-governmental and commercial crewed space exploration is bringing a more diverse group of individuals into space. This expansion raises new and relatively underexplored ethical, legal, and medical policy questions.\n\nMethods: This paper is a perspective or policy review.

These include the ethical considerations for selecting private space travelers and the standards for conducting human subject research on them, particularly in the context of commercial space operations which are not bound by the same rules as government agencies.\n\nResults: The paper identifies key areas of concern, such as the need for unified guidelines on crew selection, medical research ethics, and decision-making processes (like in-flight triage). It also points out the complexity added by the lack of universal terminology for different types of space travelers and the variety of potential mission profiles.\n\nConclusions: The authors conclude that as we enter this new era of space exploration, the community must work to ensure that future space travel is as safe and ethical as possible.

Additionally, there is growing evidence that suggests that not only is the immune system being altered, but the pathogens that infect the host are significantly influenced by spaceflight and ground-based spaceflight conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that Serratia marcescens (strain Db11) was significantly more lethal to Drosophila melanogaster after growth on the International Space Station than ground-based controls, but the increased virulence phenotype of S. marcescens did not persist after the bacterial cultures were passaged on the ground. Increased virulence was also observed in bacteria that were grown in simulated microgravity conditions on the ground using the rotating wall vessel. Increased virulence of the space-flown bacteria was similar in magnitude between wild-type flies and those that were mutants for the well-characterized immune pathways Imd and Toll, suggesting that changes to the host immune system after infection are likely not a major factor contributing towards increased susceptibility of ground-reared flies infected with space-flown bacteria. Characterization of the bacteria shows that at later timepoints spaceflight bacteria grew at a greater rate than ground controls in vitro, and in the host. These results suggest complex physiological changes occurring in pathogenic bacteria in space environments, and there may be novel mechanisms mediating these physiological effects that need to be characterized.",

Researchers demonstrated that the bacterium Serratia marcescens, after being grown on the International Space Station, was significantly more lethal to Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies). Importantly, the study suggests this increased virulence is due to physiological changes in the bacteria themselves, rather than a weakened host immune system, pointing to novel mechanisms that need to be understood for future long-duration missions.",
        "Summary": "Background: Astronauts can experience immune disorders after spaceflight, and there is growing evidence that pathogens themselves may also be altered by the space environment. This study investigated how spaceflight and simulated microgravity affect the virulence of the bacterium Serratia marcescens using the Drosophila melanogaster infection model.\n\nMethods: S. marcescens was grown on the International Space Station (ISS) and in a ground-based rotating wall vessel (RWV) to simulate microgravity. The virulence of these bacteria was then tested by infecting D. melanogaster. The study used both wild-type flies and mutants with defective immune pathways (Imd and Toll) to assess whether host immunity was a factor. The growth rate of the bacteria was also characterized both in vitro and inside the host.\n\nResults: S. marcescens grown on the ISS was significantly more lethal to the flies than ground-based controls, and a similar increase in virulence was seen with bacteria grown in the RWV. This increased virulence phenotype was not persistent after the bacteria were passaged back on the ground. The effect was similar in both wild-type and immune-deficient flies, suggesting that changes in the host's immune response were not the primary cause. Instead, the space-flown bacteria were found to grow at a greater rate.\n\nConclusions: The study suggests that complex physiological changes occur in pathogenic bacteria in space environments. The increased virulence of S. marcescens appears to be due to changes in the bacterium itself, leading to faster growth, rather than a compromised host immune system. This points to the existence of novel mechanisms mediating these effects that require further characterization."

Drosophila can be sent to space in large numbers to examine the effects of microgravity on heart structure and function, which is fundamentally conserved from flies to humans. Flies reared in microgravity exhibit cardiac constriction with myofibrillar remodeling and diminished output. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in isolated hearts revealed reduced expression of sarcomeric/extracellular matrix (ECM) genes and dramatically increased proteasomal gene expression, consistent with the observed compromised, smaller hearts and suggesting abnormal proteostasis. This was examined further on a second flight in which we found dramatically elevated proteasome aggregates co-localizing with increased amyloid and polyQ deposits. Remarkably, in long-QT causing sei/hERG mutants, proteasomal gene expression at 1g, although less than the wild-type expression, was nevertheless increased in microgravity. Therefore, cardiac remodeling and proteostatic stress may be a fundamental response of heart muscle to microgravity.",

        "Overview": "This study provides critical insights into the cardiac risks of long-duration spaceflight, using Drosophila as a powerful model system. Researchers found that flies reared in microgravity developed smaller, constricted hearts with diminished output and signs of structural remodeling. RNA-sequencing revealed that this cardiac atrophy is linked to increased protein degradation and abnormal proteostasis (protein quality control), including the accumulation of amyloid-like deposits. This suggests that cardiac remodeling and proteostatic stress are fundamental responses to microgravity, a finding essential for protecting astronaut heart health.",
        "Summary": "Background: Understanding the effects of microgravity on human organs is crucial for space exploration. The heart structure and function are fundamentally conserved between fruit flies (Drosophila) and humans, making them a useful model to study these effects in large numbers.\n\nMethods: Drosophila were reared in microgravity during two separate spaceflight missions. Upon return, their heart structure and function were examined. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on isolated hearts to analyze changes in gene expression. In the second flight, proteasome aggregates and amyloid/polyQ deposits were visualized and quantified.\n\nResults: Flies reared in microgravity exhibited cardiac constriction, myofibrillar remodeling, and reduced cardiac output, resulting in compromised, smaller hearts. RNA-seq analysis showed reduced expression of genes for sarcomeric and extracellular matrix proteins, and a dramatic increase in proteasomal gene expression. This suggested abnormal protein quality control (proteostasis), which was confirmed in a second flight by the observation of elevated proteasome aggregates co-localizing with increased amyloid and polyQ deposits.\n\nConclusions: The study concludes that cardiac remodeling and proteostatic stress appear to be a fundamental response of heart muscle to the microgravity environment. These findings in Drosophila offer a potential mechanism for the cardiac deconditioning observed in humans during spaceflight."

        "Abstract": "Primary root growth is required by the plant to anchor in the soil and reach out for nutrients and water, while dealing with obstacles. Efficient root elongation and bending depends upon the coordinated action of environmental sensing, signal transduction, and growth responses. The actin cytoskeleton is a highly plastic network that constitutes a point of integration for environmental stimuli and hormonal pathways. In this review, we present a detailed compilation highlighting the importance of the actin cytoskeleton during primary root growth and we describe how actin-binding proteins, plant hormones, and actin-disrupting drugs affect root growth and root actin. We also discuss the feedback loop between actin and root responses to light and gravity. Actin affects cell division and elongation through the control of its own organization. We remark upon the importance of longitudinally oriented actin bundles as a hallmark of cell elongation as well as the role of the actin cytoskeleton in protein trafficking and vacuolar reshaping during this process. The actin network is shaped by a plethora of actin-binding proteins; however, there is still a large gap in connecting the molecular function of these proteins with their developmental effects. Here, we summarize their function and known effects on primary root growth with a focus on their high level of specialization. Light and gravity are key factors that help us understand root growth directionality. The response of the root to gravity relies on hormonal, particularly auxin, homeostasis, and the actin cytoskeleton. Actin is necessary for the perception of the gravity stimulus via the repositioning of sedimenting statoliths, but it is also involved in mediating the growth response via the trafficking of auxin transporters and cell elongation. Furthermore, auxin and auxin analogs can affect the composition of the actin network, indicating a potential feedback loop. Light, in its turn, affects actin organization and hence, root growth, although its precise role remains largely unknown. Recently, fundamental studies with the latest techniques have given us more in-depth knowledge of the role and organization of actin in the coordination of root growth; however, there remains a lot to discover, especially in how actin organization helps cell shaping, and therefore root growth.",

        "Summary": "Background: Primary root growth is fundamental for a plant to anchor itself and acquire nutrients. This process requires a coordinated response to environmental stimuli, with the actin cytoskeleton acting as a key integration point for these signals.\n\nMethods: This is a review paper that synthesizes and compiles existing research. The authors detail the role of the actin cytoskeleton in primary root growth, covering the influence of actin-binding proteins, plant hormones (especially auxin), and actin-disrupting drugs. The paper specifically discusses the feedback loop between actin and the root's responses to gravity and light.\n\nResults: The review highlights that the actin network is crucial for both cell division and elongation. It describes how longitudinally oriented actin bundles are a hallmark of cell elongation and how actin is involved in protein trafficking and vacuole reshaping during this process. The paper emphasizes actin's dual role in gravitropism: it is necessary for perceiving the gravity stimulus (via statolith movement) and for mediating the growth response (via trafficking of auxin transporters). A feedback loop is identified where auxin itself can affect the actin network.\n\nConclusions: The abstract suggests that while recent studies have deepened our knowledge, much is still to be discovered about how actin organization directly contributes to cell shaping and overall root growth. The review underscores the importance of the actin cytoskeleton as a central player in integrating environmental and hormonal signals to guide root development and directionality."

        "Summary": "Background: The abstract for this study is a single sentence. The study used a forward-genetic screen in Arabidopsis to find mutants that were hypersensitive to latrunculin B, a drug that disrupts the actin cytoskeleton. This screen aimed to identify new proteins involved in cellular processes linked to actin.\n\nMethods: The primary method was a forward-genetic screen for mutants with increased sensitivity to latrunculin B. Once a mutant was identified, the researchers would have mapped the mutation to the HLB1 gene and then characterized the protein's function and localization, likely involving microscopy and further genetic analysis to understand its role in post-Golgi traffic.\n\nResults: The screen identified HLB1, a plant-specific protein, as a key factor. The abstract implies that loss of HLB1 function makes the plant hypersensitive to actin disruption and that HLB1 functions in the trafficking of vesicles at the trans-Golgi Network/Early Endosome (TGN/EE) interface.\n\nConclusions: The abstract implies that HLB1 is a newly identified protein that operates at the intersection of the exocytic (secretion) and endocytic (internalization) pathways at the TGN/EE. Its function is crucial for cellular processes that depend on both proper vesicle trafficking and a stable actin cytoskeleton."

        "Abstract": "When positioned horizontally, roots grow down toward the direction of gravity. This phenomenon, called gravitropism, is influenced by most of the major plant hormones including brassinosteroids. Epi-brassinolide (eBL) was previously shown to enhance root gravitropism, a phenomenon similar to the response of roots exposed to the actin inhibitor, latrunculin B (LatB). This led us to hypothesize that eBL might enhance root gravitropism through its effects on filamentous-actin (F-actin). This hypothesis was tested by comparing gravitropic responses of maize (Zea mays) roots treated with eBL or LatB. LatB- and eBL-treated roots displayed similar enhanced downward growth compared with controls when vertical roots were oriented horizontally. Moreover, the effects of the two compounds on root growth directionality were more striking on a slowly-rotating two-dimensional clinostat. Both compounds inhibited autotropism, a process in which the root straightened after the initial gravistimulus was withdrawn by clinorotation. Although eBL reduced F-actin density in chemically-fixed Z. mays roots, the impact was not as strong as that of LatB. Modification of F-actin organization after treatment with both compounds was also observed in living roots of barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) seedlings expressing genetically encoded F-actin reporters. Like in fixed Z. mays roots, eBL effects on F-actin in living M. truncatula roots were modest compared with those of LatB. Furthermore, live cell imaging revealed a decrease in global F-actin dynamics in hypocotyls of etiolated M. truncatula seedlings treated with eBL compared to controls. Collectively, our data indicate that eBL-and LatB-induced enhancement of root gravitropism can be explained by inhibited autotropic root straightening, and that eBL affects this process, in part, by modifying F-actin organization and dynamics.",

Researchers demonstrate that the hormone enhances the downward growth of roots by inhibiting autotropism (the root's tendency to straighten) and that this effect is mediated, in part, by modifying the organization and dynamics of the filamentous-actin (F-actin) cytoskeleton. This is an important read for understanding how hormonal signals are integrated with the cellular machinery to control directional growth.",

They used a two-dimensional clinostat to withdraw the initial gravity stimulus and observe autotropic straightening. F-actin organization was observed in chemically-fixed maize roots and in living roots of barrel medic seedlings expressing fluorescent F-actin reporters. Live cell imaging was also used to measure F-actin dynamics.\n\nResults: Both eBL and LatB treatments resulted in enhanced downward root growth and inhibited autotropic straightening after the gravity stimulus was removed. While LatB had a strong impact, eBL also reduced F-actin density in maize roots and modified F-actin organization in living barrel medic roots, albeit more modestly. Live cell imaging revealed that eBL decreased the overall dynamics of F-actin.\n\nConclusions: The study indicates that the enhancement of root gravitropism by both eBL and LatB can be explained by their inhibition of autotropic root straightening.

Most of these studies have relied on promoters such as Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (35S) and Ubiquitin10 (UBQ10) to drive expression of GCaMP in all cell/tissue types. Plant organs such as roots consist of various cell types that likely exhibit unique [Ca2+]cyt responses to exogenous and endogenous signals. However, few studies have addressed this question. Here, we introduce a set of Arabidopsis thaliana lines expressing GCaMP3 in five root cell types including the columella, endodermis, cortex, epidermis, and trichoblasts. We found similarities and differences in the [Ca2+]cyt signature among these root cell types when exposed to adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP), glutamate, aluminum, and salt, which are known to trigger [Ca2+]cyt increases in root cells. These cell type-targeted GCaMP3 lines provide a new resource that should enable more in depth studies that address how a particular environmental stimulus is linked to specific root developmental pathways via [Ca2+]cyt.",

        "Overview": "This paper provides a valuable new resource for the plant science community by creating a set of Arabidopsis lines that allow for the visualization of calcium signaling in specific root cell types. Calcium is a universal second messenger, but understanding its role has been hampered by the inability to resolve signals in individual cells. By expressing the GCaMP3 sensor in distinct cell layers, this study demonstrates that different root cells exhibit unique calcium signatures in response to various stimuli, opening the door for more precise investigations into how plants perceive and respond to their environment.",
        "Summary": "Background: Cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) is a crucial second messenger in plants, with its levels rising in response to numerous environmental stimuli. While genetically-encoded reporters like GCaMP have been useful, most studies have used promoters that express the sensor in all cell types, obscuring cell-specific responses within organs like the root.\n\nMethods: The researchers created a set of Arabidopsis thaliana lines expressing the calcium sensor GCaMP3 under the control of promoters specific to five different root cell types: columella, endodermis, cortex, epidermis, and trichoblasts. They then exposed the roots of these lines to various stimuli known to trigger calcium increases (ATP, glutamate, aluminum, and salt) and imaged the resulting [Ca2+]cyt signals.\n\nResults: The study found both similarities and differences in the [Ca2+]cyt signatures among the different root cell types in response to the tested stimuli. This demonstrates that individual cell layers within the root exhibit unique calcium signaling dynamics upon perception of an environmental cue.\n\nConclusions: The set of cell type-targeted GCaMP3 lines described in this study provides a new and important resource for the plant biology community. It will enable more in-depth studies to link specific environmental stimuli to distinct root developmental pathways via the precise analysis of [Ca2+]cyt signaling in individual cell types."

Previous studies have recognized that this channel has properties that make it ideal for use as a triggered nanovalve for vesicular-based targeted drug-release devices. One can even change the modality of the sensor. Briefly, the introduction of charges into the MscL pore lumen gates the channel in the absence of membrane tension; thus, by inserting compounds that acquire a charge on exposure to an alternative stimulus, such as light or pH, into the pore of the channel, controllable nanoswitches that detect these alternative modalities have been engineered. However, a charge in the pore lumen could not only encourage actuation of the nanopore but also have a significant influence on the permeation of large charged compounds, which would thus have important implications for the efficiency of drug-release devices. In this study, we used in vivo and electrophysiological approaches to demonstrate that the introduction of a charge into pore lumen of MscL does indeed influence the permeation of charged molecules.

Two MscL crystal structures of the orthologs M. tuberculosis and S. aureus have been solved showing pentameric and tetrameric structures, respectively. Several studies followed to understand whether the discrepancy in their stoichiometry was a species difference or a consequence of the protein manipulation for crystallization. Two independent studies now agree that the full-length S. aureus MscL is actually a pentamer, not tetramer. While detergents appear to play a role in modifying the oligomeric state of the protein, a cytoplasmic helical bundle has also been implicated. Here, we evaluate the role of the C-terminal region of S. aureus MscL in the oligomerization of the channel in native membranes by using an in vivo disulfide-trapping technique. We find that the oligomeric state of S. aureus MscLs with different C-terminal truncations, including the one used to obtain the tetrameric S. aureus MscL crystal structure, are pentamers in vivo.

While recent studies suggest the full-length S. aureus protein is a pentamer, it was unclear if a cytoplasmic helical bundle, which was truncated for the tetrameric crystal structure, played a role in determining this state.\n\nMethods: The researchers used an in vivo disulfide-trapping technique to determine the oligomeric state of S. aureus MscL directly within the native membranes of living cells. They tested various versions of the protein with different C-terminal truncations, including the specific truncation that was used to obtain the tetrameric crystal structure.\n\nResults: The study found that all truncated versions of the S. aureus MscL channel, including the one from the crystallization study, consistently formed pentamers when assessed in vivo. This indicates that the C-terminal domain is not required to maintain the pentameric state in the native membrane environment.\n\nConclusions: The C-terminal domain of the S. aureus MscL protein only plays a critical role in its oligomeric state when the protein is solubilized in detergent, outside of its natural membrane environment. In vivo, the channel remains a pentamer regardless of C-terminal truncations, confirming this as its native structure."

The physiological role of MscL is that of an emergency release valve that opens a large pore upon a sudden drop in the osmolarity of the environment. A crystal structure of a closed state of MscL shows it as a homopentamer, with each subunit consisting of two transmembrane domains (TM). There is consensus that the TM helices move in an iris like manner tilting in the plane of the membrane while gating. An N-terminal amphipathic helix that lies along the cytoplasmic membrane (S1), and the portion of TM2 near the cytoplasmic interface (TM2ci), are relatively close in the crystal structure, yet predicted to be dynamic upon gating. Here we determine how these two regions interact in the channel complex, and study how these interactions change as the channel opens. We have screened 143 double-cysteine mutants of E. coli MscL for their efficiency in disulfide bridging and generated a map of protein-protein interactions between these two regions. Interesting candidates have been further studied by patch clamp and show differences in channel activity under different redox potentials; the results suggest a model for the dynamics of these two domains during MscL gating.",

This study aimed to map their interactions.\n\nMethods: The researchers used a double-cysteine mutant screening approach. They created 143 different versions of E. coli MscL, each with two cysteine residues at specific positions in the S1 and TM2ci domains. By testing the efficiency of disulfide bridging between these cysteines, they could map which parts of the domains come into close contact. Promising candidates were further studied using patch-clamp electrophysiology to see how redox potential (which controls disulfide bonds) affected channel activity.\n\nResults: The screening generated a map of protein-protein interactions between the S1 and TM2ci domains. Electrophysiological studies on selected mutants showed that their channel activity was altered by different redox potentials, confirming that the engineered disulfide bridges could lock the channel in certain conformations. These results allowed the researchers to model the dynamic movements of these domains during gating.\n\nConclusions: The study successfully mapped the interactions between the S1 and TM2ci domains and provided a model for their dynamic changes during MscL channel gating. This detailed understanding of the protein's mechanics contributes significantly to our knowledge of how mechanosensitive channels function."

        "Abstract": "Single-celled organisms must survive exposure to environmental extremes. Perhaps one of the most variable and potentially life-threatening changes that can occur is that of a rapid and acute decrease in external osmolarity. This easily translates into several atmospheres of additional pressure that can build up within the cell. Without a protective mechanism against such pressures, the cell will lyse. Hence, most microbes appear to possess members of one or both families of bacterial mechanosensitive channels, MscS and MscL, which can act as biological emergency release valves that allow cytoplasmic solutes to be jettisoned rapidly from the cell. While this is undoubtedly a function of these proteins, the discovery of the presence of MscS homologues in plant organelles and MscL in fungus and mycoplasma genomes may complicate this simplistic interpretation of the physiology underlying these proteins. Here we compare and contrast these two mechanosensitive channel families, discuss their potential physiological roles, and review some of the most relevant data that underlie the current models for their structure and function.",

It contrasts the structure and function of these two key channel types, which protect cells from bursting under osmotic stress. The paper is valuable for microbiologists and cell biologists as it not only summarizes their primary physiological role but also discusses the complexities arising from their discovery in a wider range of organisms, including plants and fungi, suggesting their functions may be more diverse than previously thought.",
        "Summary": "Background: Single-celled organisms need mechanisms to survive rapid decreases in external osmolarity, which can cause them to burst. Most microbes possess one or both of two families of mechanosensitive channels, MscS and MscL, that act as emergency release valves to jettison solutes and relieve internal pressure.\n\nMethods: This is a review article. The authors compare and contrast the MscS and MscL channel families, drawing on existing literature. They discuss the current models for their structure, function, and physiological roles.\n\nResults: The review summarizes that MscS and MscL are the primary defense against osmotic downshock in microbes. It also notes that the discovery of MscS homologs in plant organelles and MscL in fungi and mycoplasma complicates the simple interpretation of their function, suggesting they may have other physiological roles beyond being just emergency release valves.\n\nConclusions: The review provides a comprehensive look at the two major families of bacterial mechanosensitive channels. It highlights their critical role as emergency release valves while also pointing to emerging evidence that suggests their functions may be more varied and complex across different domains of life."

While all MscL homologs have channel activity, they often show functional differences in their sensitivity and kinetics. This study aimed to identify the structural regions responsible for these differences.\n\nMethods: The researchers created chimeric proteins by swapping different regions between the MscL channels of E. coli and S. aureus. The function of these chimeras was then tested to determine which region controlled the channel's open dwell time and its threshold for opening in response to membrane tension.\n\nResults: The study found that the periplasmic region of the first transmembrane domain, specifically a single residue at the lipid-aqueous interface (I49 in E. coli and F47 in S. aureus), had a drastic influence on both the channel's opening threshold and its kinetics. One mutant at this site exhibited severe hysteresis, confirming the residue's importance in the energy barriers for gating.\n\nConclusions: The authors propose that this single residue acts like a spring, adjusting the energy required to open the channel and stabilize it in either the open or closed state.

TDPs are often expressed at high levels in tardigrades upon desiccation, and appear to mediate stress adaptation. Here, we focus on the proteins belonging to the secreted family of tardigrade proteins termed secretory-abundant heat soluble (\u201cSAHS\u201d) proteins, and investigate their ability to protect diverse biological structures. Recombinantly expressed SAHS proteins prevent desiccated liposomes from fusion, and enhance desiccation tolerance of E. coli and Rhizobium tropici upon extracellular application. Molecular dynamics simulation and comparative structural analysis suggest a model by which SAHS proteins may undergo a structural transition upon desiccation, in which removal of water and solutes from a large internal cavity in SAHS proteins destabilizes the beta-sheet structure.

They assessed whether the proteins could prevent desiccated liposomes (artificial cell membranes) from fusing. They also tested if applying SAHS proteins externally could enhance the survival of E. coli and Rhizobium tropici bacteria after desiccation. Molecular dynamics simulations and structural analysis were used to model the protein's behavior upon drying.\n\nResults: The SAHS proteins were highly effective. They prevented desiccated liposomes from fusing together and significantly improved the survival rate of desiccated bacteria. The computer simulations suggest a model where the removal of water causes a structural transition in the SAHS proteins, destabilizing their beta-sheet structure, which is key to their protective function.\n\nConclusions: The results highlight the potential application of SAHS proteins as stabilizing molecules. They could be used for the preservation of cells, therapeutics, or other biological materials in a dried state, potentially removing the need for cold storage."

        "Abstract": "Anhydrobiosis, a phenomenon in which organisms survive extreme dehydration by entering a reversible ametabolic state, is a remarkable example of survival strategies. This study focuses on anhydrobiosis in tardigrades, which are known for their resilience to severe environmental conditions. Tardigrades utilize several protective mechanisms against desiccation, notably the constitutive expression of cytoplasmic abundant heat soluble (CAHS) proteins in Ramazzottius varieornatus. These proteins share similarities in their amphiphatic alpha helices with late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, but differ significantly in their amino acid sequences. In this study, we further explored the functionality of CAHS proteins by analyzing their role in aggregation and tolerance to hyperosmotic stress in mammalian cells. Using live cell imaging, we examined the subcellular localization of several CAHS and LEA proteins in response to hyperosmotic stress. The expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, and CAHS8 tended to enhance the resilience to the hyperosmotic conditions. These findings not only deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of anhydrobiosis but also highlight the potential of CAHS proteins as cryoprotectants.",
        "Conclusion": "In this study, we expressed R. varieornatus CAHS proteins in HeLa cells to investigate their effects on resistance to hyperosmotic stress, an early step in anhydrobiosis. All of these proteins demonstrated reversible aggregation upon hyperosmotic stress in HeLa cells, exhibiting granular and filamentous structures (Fig. 1). Furthermore, we found that expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, and CAHS8 conferred resistance to sorbitol-induced hyperosmotic stress in HeLa cells (Figs. 2 and 3). These results not only provide new insights into the mechanism of desiccation tolerance in R. varieornatus, but also suggest a potential use of these CAHS proteins as cryoprotectants.",

Nevertheless, some animals evolved anhydrobiosis, a strategy allowing for the reversible organism dehydration and suspension of metabolism as a direct response to habitat desiccation. Anhydrobiotic animals undergo biochemical changes synthesizing bioprotectants to help combat desiccation stresses. One stress is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, the eutardigrade Paramacrobiotus spatialis was used to investigate the occurrence of ROS associated with the desiccation process. We observed that the production of ROS significantly increases as a function of time spent in anhydrobiosis and represents a direct demonstration of oxidative stress in tardigrades. The degree of involvement of bioprotectants, including those combating ROS, in the P. spatialis was evaluated by perturbing their gene functions using RNA interference and assessing the successful recovery of animals after desiccation/rehydration. Targeting the glutathione peroxidase gene compromised survival during drying and rehydration, providing evidence for the role of the gene in desiccation tolerance. Targeting genes encoding glutathione reductase and catalase indicated that these molecules play roles during rehydration. Our study also confirms the involvement of aquaporins 3 and 10 during rehydration. Therefore, desiccation tolerance depends on the synergistic action of many different molecules working together.",

        "Summary": "Background: Anhydrobiosis is a survival strategy where organisms reversibly dehydrate.

This study aimed to directly investigate the occurrence of ROS and the role of antioxidant bioprotectants in the tardigrade Paramacrobiotus spatialis during desiccation.\n\nMethods: Researchers measured the production of ROS in P. spatialis as a function of time spent in anhydrobiosis. To evaluate the role of specific bioprotectants, they used RNA interference (RNAi) to perturb the function of genes for glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and catalase, as well as aquaporins. The survival and successful recovery of these animals after desiccation and rehydration were then assessed.\n\nResults: The study found that ROS production significantly increases the longer a tardigrade spends in anhydrobiosis, providing a direct demonstration of oxidative stress. Targeting the glutathione peroxidase gene compromised the tardigrades' survival during the drying and rehydration process. Targeting glutathione reductase and catalase revealed their roles during the rehydration phase. The study also confirmed the involvement of aquaporins during rehydration.\n\nConclusions: The abstract suggests that desiccation tolerance in tardigrades is not due to a single mechanism but depends on the synergistic action of many different molecules working together.

The novel hardware allows for reduced loading between 10 and 80% of normal body weight on all four limbs and enables characteristic quadrupedal locomotion. Ten-week-old female BALB/cByJ mice were supported for 21 days under Mars-analog suspension (38% weight bearing) and compared with age-matched and jacketed (100% weight bearing) controls. After an initial adaptation, weight gain did not differ between groups, suggesting low levels of animal stress. Relative to age-matched controls, mice exposed to Mars-analog loading had significantly lower muscle mass (\u221223% gastrocnemius wet mass, P < 0.0001); trabecular and cortical bone morphology (i.e., trabecular bone volume: \u221224% at the distal femur, and cortical thickness: \u221211% at the femoral midshaft, both P < 0.001); and biomechanical properties of the femoral midshaft (i.e., \u221227% ultimate moment, P < 0.001). Bone formation indexes were decreased compared with age-matched full-weight-bearing mice, whereas resorption parameters were largely unchanged. Singly housed, full-weight-bearing controls with forelimb jackets were largely similar to age-matched, group-housed controls, although a few variables differed and warrant further investigation. Altogether, these data provide strong rationale for use of our new model of partial weight bearing to further explore the musculoskeletal response to reduced loading environments.",

Ten-week-old female BALB/cByJ mice were suspended for 21 days under a Mars-analog condition (38% weight bearing). Their outcomes were compared to age-matched controls and a jacketed, full-weight-bearing control group. Musculoskeletal health was assessed via muscle mass, micro-CT analysis of trabecular and cortical bone, and biomechanical testing of the femur.\n\nResults: After an initial adaptation period, suspended mice gained weight normally, suggesting low stress levels. Compared to controls, mice in the Mars-analog group had significantly lower gastrocnemius muscle mass (-23%), reduced trabecular bone volume in the femur (-24%), thinner femoral cortical bone (-11%), and weaker femoral bones (-27% ultimate moment). Bone formation was decreased, while bone resorption parameters were largely unchanged.\n\nConclusions: The data provide a strong rationale for using this new partial weight bearing model to explore the musculoskeletal response to reduced loading environments. The system effectively simulates partial gravity, producing significant and measurable deficits in both muscle and bone, making it a valuable tool for future spaceflight-related research."

        "Abstract": "Although the musculoskeletal system is known to be sensitive to changes in its mechanical environment, the relationship between functional adaptation and below-normal mechanical stimuli is not well defined. We investigated bone and muscle adaptation to a range of reduced loading using the partial weight suspension (PWS) system, in which a two-point harness is used to offload a tunable amount of body weight while maintaining quadrupedal locomotion. Skeletally mature female C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to partial weight bearing at 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 21 days. A hindlimb unloaded (HLU) group was included for comparison in addition to age-matched controls in normal housing. Gait kinematics was measured across the full range of weight bearing, and some minor alterations in gait from PWS were identified. With PWS, bone and muscle changes were generally proportional to the degree of unloading. Specifically, total body and hindlimb bone mineral density, calf muscle mass, trabecular bone volume of the distal femur, and cortical area of the femur midshaft were all linearly related to the degree of unloading. Even a load reduction to 70% of normal weight bearing was associated with significant bone deterioration and muscle atrophy. Weight bearing at 20% did not lead to better bone outcomes than HLU despite less muscle atrophy and presumably greater mechanical stimulus, requiring further investigation. These data confirm that the PWS model is highly effective in applying controllable, reduced, long-term loading that produces predictable, discrete adaptive changes in muscle and bone of the hindlimb.",

        "Overview": "This research provides crucial, quantitative data for understanding how the musculoskeletal system adapts to reduced gravity, making it highly relevant for space medicine. Using a partial weight suspension (PWS) model in mice, the study demonstrates a clear, linear relationship between the degree of mechanical unloading and the extent of bone and muscle loss. The finding that even a small reduction in loading (to 70% of body weight) causes significant deterioration underscores the sensitivity of bone and muscle to mechanical stimuli and informs the development of exercise countermeasures for astronauts.",
        "Summary": "Background: While it is well-known that the musculoskeletal system adapts to its mechanical environment, the precise relationship between varying levels of below-normal loading and the resulting adaptation is not well defined. This study aimed to quantify bone and muscle changes across a range of reduced loading levels.\n\nMethods: Skeletally mature female C57Bl/6 mice were subjected to 21 days of partial weight suspension (PWS) at 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of their normal body weight. A hindlimb unloaded (HLU) group was also included for comparison. Gait kinematics, bone mineral density, calf muscle mass, and femoral trabecular and cortical bone architecture were measured.\n\nResults: The study found that bone and muscle changes were generally proportional to the degree of unloading. Total body and hindlimb bone mineral density, calf muscle mass, trabecular bone volume, and femoral cortical area all showed a linear relationship with the level of weight bearing. Even a modest reduction to 70% weight bearing led to significant bone deterioration and muscle atrophy. Interestingly, 20% weight bearing did not produce better bone outcomes than complete hindlimb unloading.\n\nConclusions: The PWS model is highly effective in applying controllable levels of reduced loading that produce predictable and discrete adaptive changes in the muscle and bone of the hindlimb. The findings confirm that the musculoskeletal system is highly sensitive to the magnitude of mechanical stimuli, with deterioration occurring in proportion to the degree of unloading."

In the first, gastrocnemius muscles were collected from mice after a 13-day space shuttle mission (STS-135) and compared to ground controls. In the second, mice underwent 13 days of hindlimb unloading (HLU), a ground-based analog for microgravity, and were compared to controls. EIM measurements were made on the ex vivo muscles. Muscle fiber size and hindlimb areal bone mineral density (aBMD) were also measured to correlate with the EIM data.\n\nResults: Both the spaceflight and HLU groups showed significant reductions in the EIM multifrequency phase-slope parameter compared to their respective controls, indicating similar changes in muscle electrical properties due to unloading. This EIM parameter also showed a strong correlation with muscle fiber size (\u03c1=0.65) and with hindlimb aBMD (\u03c1=0.65), linking the muscle electrical changes directly to physical muscle atrophy and associated bone loss.\n\nConclusions: The data support the concept that EIM may be a useful and non-invasive tool for assessing muscle disuse atrophy secondary to either immobilization on Earth or exposure to microgravity in space."

        "Abstract": "Spaceflight has several detrimental effects on the physiology of astronauts, many of which are recapitulated in rodent models. Mouse studies performed on the Space Shuttle showed disruption of lipid metabolism in liver. However, given that these animals were not sacrificed on-orbit and instead returned live to earth, it is unclear if these disruptions were solely induced by space stressors (e.g. microgravity, space radiation) or in part explained by the stress of return to Earth. In this work we analyzed three liver datasets from two different strains of mice (C57BL/6 (Jackson) & BALB/c (Taconic)) flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Notably, these animals were sacrificed on-orbit and exposed to varying spaceflight durations (i.e. 21, 37, and 42 days vs 13 days for the Shuttle mice). Oil Red O (ORO) staining showed abnormal lipid accumulation in all space-flown mice compared to ground controls regardless of strain or exposure duration. Similarly, transcriptomic analysis by RNA-sequencing revealed several pathways that were affected in both strains related to increased lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, lipid and fatty acid processing, lipid catabolic processing, and lipid localization. In addition, key upstream regulators were predicted to be commonly regulated across all conditions including Glucagon (GCG) and Insulin (INS). Moreover, quantitative proteomic analysis showed that a number of lipid related proteins were changed in the livers during spaceflight. Taken together, these data indicate that activation of lipotoxic pathways are the result of space stressors alone and this activation occurs in various genetic backgrounds during spaceflight exposures of weeks to months. If similar responses occur in humans, a prolonged change of these pathways may result in the development of liver disease and should be investigated further.",

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Previous work has shown that the soluble murine BMPR1A\u2013fusion protein (mBMPR1A\u2010mFc) binds to BMP2 and BMP4 with high affinity, preventing downstream signaling. Further, treatment of intact and ovariectomized mice with mBMPR1A\u2010mFc leads to increased bone mass, and improved bone microarchitecture and strength, via increased bone formation and reduced resorption. In this study, we tested the effects of mBMPR1A\u2010mFc on disuse\u2010induced bone loss caused by 21 days of hindlimb unloading (HLU) via tail suspension versus cage controls (CONs). Adult female C57BL/6J mice (12 weeks old) were assigned to one of four groups (n = 10 each): CON\u2010VEH; CON\u2010mBMPR1A\u2010mFc; HLU\u2010VEH; and HLU\u2010mBMPR1A\u2010mFc. Mice were injected subcutaneously with VEH or mBMPR1A\u2010mFc (4.5 mg/kg, 2\u00d7/week). Leg BMD declined in the HLU\u2010VEH group (\u20135.3% \u00b1 1.3%), whereas it was unchanged in HLU\u2010mBMPR1A\u2010mFc (\u20130.3% \u00b1 0.9%, p < 0.05 versus HLU\u2010VEH). Leg BMD increased significantly more in CON\u2010mBMPR1A\u2010mFc than CON\u2010VEH (10.2% \u00b1 0.6% versus 4.4% \u00b1 0.8%). In the femur, trabecular, and cortical bone microarchitecture was worse in the HLU\u2010VEH compared to CON\u2010VEH mice, whereas mBMPR1A\u2010mFc treatment for 3 weeks led to greater Tb.BV/TV, Tb.Th, and midshaft Ct.Th in both the HLU and CON groups compared to comparable VEH\u2010treated counterparts (p < 0.05). HLU\u2010mBMPR1A\u2010mFc mice also had 21% greater failure load (p < 0.05) compared to their VEH\u2010treated counterparts. Dynamic histomorphometry indicated that treatment with mBMPR1A\u2010mFc led to significantly greater mineralizing surface and mineral apposition rate, resulting in a 3.5\u2010fold and fivefold higher bone formation rate in the mBMPR1A\u2010mFc\u2010treated CON and HLU animals versus VEH groups, respectively. mBMPR1A\u2010mFc\u2010treated mice had a similar osteoblast surface but significantly lower osteoclast surface than VEH\u2010treated animals in both the CON and HLU groups. Altogether, these findings suggest that treatment with the soluble BMPR1A fusion protein may be useful for maintenance of skeletal integrity in the setting of disuse\u2010induced bone loss. \u00a9 2017 The Authors JBMR Plus published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",

The study demonstrates that a soluble BMP receptor fusion protein (mBMPR1A\u2013mFc) can not only prevent disuse-induced bone loss but also actively increase bone mass in mice subjected to hindlimb unloading. By simultaneously boosting bone formation and reducing resorption, this agent shows significant potential for maintaining skeletal integrity in unloading conditions.",
        "Summary": "Background: A soluble fusion protein, mBMPR1A\u2013mFc, which blocks certain bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signals, has been previously shown to increase bone mass in normal and ovariectomized mice. This study aimed to test its effectiveness against disuse-induced bone loss.\n\nMethods: Adult female mice were subjected to 21 days of hindlimb unloading (HLU) to simulate disuse. During this period, mice were treated with either a vehicle (VEH) or the mBMPR1A\u2013mFc fusion protein. Normally loaded control (CON) mice were also treated with either VEH or the protein. Bone mineral density (BMD), bone microarchitecture (via micro-CT), bone strength (via biomechanical testing), and bone cell activity (via dynamic histomorphometry) were assessed.\n\nResults: In vehicle-treated mice, HLU caused a significant decline in leg BMD and worsened bone microarchitecture. However, in HLU mice treated with mBMPR1A\u2013mFc, leg BMD was unchanged and bone microarchitecture was significantly greater than in their vehicle-treated counterparts. The treatment dramatically increased the bone formation rate (by fivefold in HLU animals) and reduced the osteoclast surface. As a result, treated HLU mice had 21% greater femoral failure load than untreated HLU mice.\n\nConclusions: The findings suggest that treatment with the soluble BMPR1A fusion protein is a potent strategy for maintaining skeletal integrity in the setting of disuse-induced bone loss. Its dual action of stimulating bone formation and reducing resorption makes it a promising therapeutic candidate."

        "Abstract": "Introduction: It may take decades to develop cardiovascular dysfunction following exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation from medical therapy or from nuclear accidents. Since astronauts may be exposed continually to a complex space radiation environment unlike that experienced on Earth, it is unresolved whether there is a risk to cardiovascular health during long-term space exploration missions. Previously, we have described that mice exposed to a single dose of simplified Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR5-ion) develop cardiovascular dysfunction by 12 months post-radiation. Methods: To investigate the biological basis of this dysfunction, here we performed a quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of heart tissue (proteome and phosphoproteome) and plasma (proteome only) from these mice at 8 months post-radiation. Results: Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) for irradiated versus sham irradiated samples (fold-change \u22651.2 and an adjusted p-value of \u22640.05) were identified for each proteomics data set. For the heart proteome, there were 87 significant DEPs (11 upregulated and 76 downregulated); for the heart phosphoproteome, there were 60 significant differentially phosphorylated peptides (17 upregulated and 43 downregulated); and for the plasma proteome, there was only one upregulated protein. A Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) technique that assesses canonical pathways from BIOCARTA, KEGG, PID, REACTOME, and WikiPathways revealed significant perturbation in pathways in each data set. For the heart proteome, 166 pathways were significantly altered (36 upregulated and 130 downregulated); for the plasma proteome, there were 73 pathways significantly altered (25 upregulated and 48 downregulated); and for the phosphoproteome, there were 223 pathways significantly affected at 0.1 adjusted p-value cutoff. Pathways related to inflammation were the most highly perturbed in the heart and plasma. In line with sustained inflammation, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were demonstrated to be increased in GCR5-ion irradiated hearts at 12-month post irradiation. NETs play a fundamental role in combating bacterial pathogens, modulating inflammatory responses, inflicting damage on healthy tissues, and escalating vascular thrombosis. Discussion: These findings suggest that a single exposure to GCR5-ion results in long-lasting changes in the proteome and that these proteomic changes can potentiate acute and chronic health issues for astronauts, such as what we have previously described with late cardiac dysfunction in these mice.",

        "Overview": "This paper is critical for understanding the long-term cardiovascular risks of deep space travel, providing a detailed molecular snapshot of the heart's response to simulated galactic cosmic radiation (GCR). Using proteomics, researchers identified persistent changes in heart and plasma proteins 8 months after a single GCR exposure in mice. The most highly perturbed pathways were related to inflammation, a finding supported by the late-stage presence of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). This suggests that a single GCR exposure can trigger long-lasting inflammation, potentiating chronic cardiovascular health issues for astronauts.",
        "Summary": "Background: There is a risk of cardiovascular dysfunction following exposure to space radiation, but the biological basis is not well understood. Previous work showed that mice exposed to a simplified 5-ion Galactic Cosmic Ray simulation (GCR5-ion) develop cardiovascular dysfunction 12 months later. This study aimed to investigate the molecular changes at an earlier time point.\n\nMethods: Heart tissue (proteome and phosphoproteome) and plasma (proteome) were collected from mice 8 months after a single exposure to GCR5-ion radiation. Quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics was used to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and differentially phosphorylated peptides compared to sham-irradiated controls. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was used to identify altered biological pathways. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were also measured in heart tissue at 12 months post-irradiation.\n\nResults: The heart proteome showed 87 DEPs, while the phosphoproteome had 60 differentially phosphorylated peptides. Pathway analysis revealed significant perturbations in all datasets, with inflammation-related pathways being the most highly affected in both the heart and plasma. Consistent with sustained inflammation, the presence of NETs, which are involved in inflammation and thrombosis, was found to be increased in the irradiated hearts 12 months after exposure.\n\nConclusions: The study suggests that a single exposure to simulated GCR results in long-lasting changes to the proteome of the heart and plasma. These changes, particularly the sustained inflammation, can potentiate both acute and chronic health issues, such as the late cardiac dysfunction previously observed in these mice, and may represent a significant risk for astronauts."

If we assume gravity has remained constant during the species' evolution, will its sensory system adapt to abrupt loss of that force? We address this question in the land snail Helix lucorum exposed to 30 days of near weightlessness aboard the Bion-M1 satellite, and studied geotactic behavior of postflight snails, differential gene expressions in statocyst transcriptome, and electrophysiological responses of mechanoreceptors to applied tilts. Each approach revealed plastic changes in the snail's vestibular system assumed in response to spaceflight. Absence of light during the mission also affected statocyst physiology, as revealed by comparison to dark-conditioned control groups. Readaptation to normal tilt responses occurred at ~20 h following return to Earth. Despite the permanence of gravity, the snail responded in a compensatory manner to its loss and readapted once gravity was restored.",

By examining land snails after a 30-day mission, researchers found behavioral, transcriptomic, and electrophysiological changes indicating a compensatory adaptation to the absence of gravity. The snail's vestibular system became more sensitive to acceleration, and it readapted to Earth's gravity within about 20 hours. This work demonstrates that even systems evolved under a constant gravitational pull can adapt to its loss, offering insights into fundamental principles of sensory plasticity.",
        "Summary": "Background: The vestibular system, which controls balance, has evolved under the constant influence of Earth's gravity. This study addressed whether this sensory system could adapt to the abrupt loss of that force by studying the land snail Helix lucorum after a 30-day spaceflight on the Bion-M1 satellite.\n\nMethods: The study used a multi-pronged approach. Post-flight, researchers examined the snails' geotactic behavior (orientation to gravity). They performed transcriptome analysis to measure differential gene expression in the statocyst (the gravity-sensing organ). Finally, they made electrophysiological recordings of mechanoreceptors from the statocyst to measure their responses to applied tilts.\n\nResults: All three approaches revealed plastic changes in the snail's vestibular system. Post-flight snails showed an enhanced negative gravitaxis response (faster re-orientation away from a head-down tilt). Their statoreceptors responded with a larger magnitude to tilts, indicating increased sensitivity to acceleration. Transcriptome analysis revealed a significant increase in the expression of a gene encoding Helix pedal peptide (HPep), which is linked to ciliary beating in the statoreceptors. These changes began to readapt back to normal around 20 hours after returning to Earth.\n\nConclusions: Despite the evolutionary permanence of gravity, the snail's vestibular system responded in a compensatory manner to its absence and was able to readapt upon its restoration. This suggests a fundamental capacity for neuroplasticity in gravity-sensing systems."

Here we present an anatomical description of this structure in the adult oyster toadfish, and establish a morphological basis for interpretation of subsequent functional studies. Light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy techniques were applied to visualize the sensory epithelium at varying levels of detail, its neural innervation and its synaptic organization. Scanning electron microscopy was used to visualize otolith mass and morphological polarization patterns of hair cells. Afferent nerve fibers were visualized following labeling with biocytin, and light microscope images were used to make three-dimensional (3-D) reconstructions of individual labeled afferents to identify dendritic morphology with respect to epithelial location. Transmission electron micrographs were compiled to create a serial 3-D reconstruction of a labeled afferent over a segment of its dendritic field and to examine the cell-afferent synaptic contacts. Major observations are: a well-defined striola, medial and lateral extra-striolar regions with a zonal organization of hair bundles; prominent lacinia projecting laterally; dependence of hair cell density on macular location; narrow afferent dendritic fields that follow the hair bundle polarization; synaptic specializations issued by afferents are typically directed towards a limited number of 7\u201313 hair cells, but larger dendritic fields in the medial extra-striola can be associated with > 20 hair cells also; and hair cell synaptic bodies can be confined to only an individual afferent or can synapse upon several afferents.",

        "Abstract": "Gravity has remained constant during animal evolution and the neural sensory systems detecting acceleration forces have remained remarkably conserved among vertebrates. The utricular organ senses the sum of inertial force due to head translation and head tilt relative to gravitational vertical. Change in gravitational force would be expected to have profound effects on how an organism maintains equilibrium. We characterize the physiology of utricular afferents to applied accelerations in the oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau, in normal 1 g to establish benchmarks, after 1\u201332-day exposures to 2.24 g (resultant) via centrifugation (hypergravity, HG), after 4- and 16-day exposures to 1.12 g (resultant), and following 1\u20138 days recovery to HG exposures to study re-adaptation to 1 g. Afferents were also examined during activation of efferent vestibular pathway. Centrifugation at 2.24 g included 228\u00b0/s constant angular velocity component, and thus horizontal canal afferent responses to yaw rotation were recorded as an internal control in each fish. Afferents studied after 228\u00b0/s rotation for 4 and 16 days without centripetal acceleration, called On-Center-Control, were indistinguishable from their control counterparts. Principal response to HG was an adjustment of afferent sensitivity as a function of magnitude and duration of exposure: an initial robust increase at 3\u20134 days followed by a significant decrease from 16 to 32 days. Initial increase observed after 4 days of HG took >4 days in 1 g to recover, and the decrease observed after 16 days of HG took >2 days to readapt to 1 g. Hair cells in striola and medial extrastriola macula regions were serially reconstructed in 3D from thin sections using transmission electron microscopy in control fish and fish exposed to 4 and 16 days of HG. Despite the highly significant differences in afferent physiology, synaptic body counts quantified in the same fish were equivalent in their inter-animal variability and averages. No clear role of the efferent pathway as a feedback mechanism regulating afferent behavior to HG was found. Transfer from 1 g to HG imparts profound effects on gravitational sensitivity of utricular afferents and the accompanying transfer from the HG back to the 1 g resembles in part (as an analog) the transfer from 1 g to the micrograms.",

By exposing fish to sustained hypergravity via centrifugation, researchers found that the sensitivity of utricular afferent neurons first increases and then decreases over time, demonstrating a complex, time-dependent plasticity. These findings are highly relevant to space medicine, as the adaptation to hypergravity and subsequent readaptation to 1 g serve as a valuable analog for understanding the profound effects that transferring from 1 g to microgravity might have on astronaut balance and orientation.",
        "Summary": "Background: The utricular organ senses linear acceleration, including gravity. Changes in gravitational force are expected to have a profound effect on an organism's sense of equilibrium. This study aimed to characterize how the physiology of utricular afferents in the toadfish adapts to sustained hypergravity (HG) and then readapts to normal 1 g.\n\nMethods: The researchers exposed toadfish to 2.24 g or 1.12 g via centrifugation for durations ranging from 1 to 32 days. They then performed electrophysiological recordings of utricular afferents to measure their sensitivity to applied accelerations. The responses were compared to normal 1 g controls and animals that readapted to 1 g for 1-8 days after HG exposure. The synaptic structure of hair cells was also examined using 3D transmission electron microscopy.\n\nResults: The principal response to hypergravity was an adjustment of afferent sensitivity that depended on both the magnitude and duration of the exposure. After 3-4 days of 2.24 g, afferent sensitivity robustly increased. However, with longer exposure (16-32 days), the sensitivity significantly decreased. These changes took several days to recover upon return to 1 g. Despite these significant physiological changes, there were no corresponding changes in the number of synaptic bodies in the hair cells.\n\nConclusions: The study demonstrates that transfer to a hypergravity environment imparts profound, time-dependent effects on the gravitational sensitivity of utricular afferents. The process of adapting to HG and then readapting to 1 g is proposed as an analog for the sensory changes that occur during the transition from 1 g to microgravity during spaceflight, which could have implications for astronaut vestibular function."

The UPR is critical for growth and development; nonetheless, connections between the UPR and other cellular regulatory processes remain largely unknown. Here, we identify a link between the UPR and the phytohormone auxin, a master regulator of plant physiology. We show that ER stress triggers down-regulation of auxin sensors and transporters in Arabidopsis thaliana. We also demonstrate that an Arabidopsis mutant of a conserved ER stress sensor IRE1 exhibits defects in the auxin response and levels. These data not only support that the plant IRE1 is required for auxin homeostasis, they also reveal a species-specific feature of IRE1 in multicellular eukaryotes. Furthermore, by establishing that UPR activation is reduced in mutants of ER-localized auxin transporters, including PIN5, we define a long-neglected biological significance of ER-based auxin regulation. We further examine the functional relationship of IRE1 and PIN5 by showing that an ire1 pin5 triple mutant enhances defects of UPR activation and auxin homeostasis in ire1 or pin5. Our results imply that the plant UPR has evolved a hormone-dependent strategy for coordinating ER function with physiological processes.",

Researchers demonstrate a two-way interaction where ER stress downregulates auxin response, and mutants in the ER stress sensor IRE1 have defects in auxin homeostasis. This discovery of hormone-dependent UPR coordination is crucial for understanding how plants integrate organelle function with overall physiological processes to manage stress.",
        "Summary": "Background: The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a critical signaling network that responds to stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, its connections to other cellular regulatory processes, like hormone signaling, are largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate a potential link between the UPR and the master plant hormone, auxin.\n\nMethods: The researchers used Arabidopsis thaliana to study the interplay between ER stress and auxin. They induced ER stress and measured the expression of auxin sensors and transporters. They analyzed an ire1 mutant (lacking a key ER stress sensor) for defects in auxin levels and response. They also used mutants of ER-localized auxin transporters (like pin5) to see if this affected UPR activation. Finally, they created a triple mutant (ire1 pin5) to examine the functional relationship.\n\nResults: ER stress was found to trigger the downregulation of auxin sensors and transporters. The ire1 mutant exhibited defects in both auxin response and auxin levels. Conversely, UPR activation was reduced in pin5 mutants, establishing a role for ER-based auxin regulation in the UPR. The ire1 pin5 triple mutant showed even greater defects in both UPR activation and auxin homeostasis, confirming a functional link.\n\nConclusions: The results imply that the plant UPR has evolved a strategy to coordinate ER function with physiological processes through a dependency on hormone signaling. This study establishes a previously unknown inter-regulation between the UPR and auxin signaling, highlighting a species-specific feature of the IRE1 sensor."

It highlights the ER as a dynamic organelle that not only manages protein folding under stress (via the UPR and ERAD) but also undergoes morphological changes, such as forming ER bodies. This link between ER shape and function is crucial for understanding how plants manage stress, from protein quality control to programmed cell death.",
        "Summary": "Background: The abstract for this paper was not found. The title suggests the paper explores how the shape and structure of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are linked to its function, particularly in how the cell translates stress signals into appropriate responses.\n\nMethods: The abstract was not found. The study likely involved advanced microscopy to observe changes in ER morphology under various stress conditions. It would also likely involve molecular techniques to measure the activation of stress response pathways like the unfolded protein response (UPR) and ER-associated degradation (ERAD), and to monitor processes like programmed cell death.\n\nResults: The abstract was not found. The keywords suggest the study found links between ER stress, the activation of bZIP transcription factors, and the involvement of myosins and caspases. A key result would be the observation of specific ER structural changes, like the formation of ER bodies containing proteins like cysteine endopeptidases, and connecting these changes to functional outcomes like programmed cell death.\n\nConclusions: The abstract and conclusion were not found. The study likely concludes that the ER is not just a passive site for protein synthesis but an active participant in stress signaling, where its dynamic shape and structural reorganization are integral to its ability to manage protein quality and execute cell fate decisions under stress."

        "Abstract": "Summary Much like a factory, the endoplasmic reticulum assembles simple cellular building blocks into complex molecular machines known as proteins. In order to protect the delicate protein folding process and ensure the proper cellular delivery of protein products under environmental stresses, eukaryotes have evolved a set of signaling mechanisms known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) to increase the folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum. This process is particularly important in plants, because their sessile nature commands adaptation for survival rather than escape from stress. As such, plants make special use of the UPR, and evidence indicates that the master regulators and downstream effectors of the UPR have distinct roles in mediating cellular processes that affect organism growth and development as well as stress responses. In this review we outline recent developments in this field that support a strong relevance of the UPR to many areas of plant life.",

In plants, the relationship between the UPR and ROS is less clear. Although ROS develop during ER stress, the sources of ROS linked to ER stress responses and the physiological impact of ROS generation on the survival from proteotoxic stress are yet unknown. Here we show that in Arabidopsis thaliana the respiratory burst oxidase homologs, RBOHD and RBOHF, contribute to the production of ROS during ER stress. We also demonstrate that during ER stress RBOHD and RBOHF are necessary to properly mount the adaptive UPR and overcome temporary and chronic ER stress situations.

Crucially, it was demonstrated that these NADPH oxidases, and the ROS they produce, are necessary for the plant to properly activate the adaptive UPR.

To contribute to the understanding of how plants respond to spaceflight stress, we examined the significance of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a conserved signaling cascade that responds to a number of unfavorable environmental stresses, in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. To do so, we performed a large-scale comparative transcriptome profiling in wild type and various UPR-defective mutants during the SpaceX-CRS12 mission to the International Space Station. We established that orbital culture substantially alters the expression of hundreds of stress-related genes compared with ground control conditions. Although expression of those genes varied in the UPR mutants on the ground, it was largely similar across the genotypes in the spaceflight condition. Our results have yielded new information on how plants respond to growth in orbit and support the hypothesis that spaceflight induces the activation of signaling pathways that compensate for the loss of UPR regulators in the control of downstream transcriptional regulatory networks.",

By comparing the transcriptomes of wild-type Arabidopsis and mutants defective in the unfolded protein response (UPR) grown on the ISS, researchers found that spaceflight dramatically alters stress-related gene expression. Interestingly, while the UPR mutants behaved differently on the ground, their gene expression in space became largely similar to the wild type, suggesting that spaceflight activates compensatory signaling pathways that bypass these specific stress regulators.",
        "Summary": "Background: Understanding how plants respond to the unique stresses of spaceflight is essential for their use in future life support systems. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a conserved signaling pathway that responds to many environmental stresses, but its relevance to the spaceflight environment was unknown.\n\nMethods: The study performed a large-scale comparative transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) on Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings grown during the SpaceX-CRS12 mission on the International Space Station. The experiment included wild-type plants and various mutants with defects in the UPR signaling cascade. The gene expression profiles of space-grown plants were compared to those of identical ground controls.\n\nResults: Orbital culture (spaceflight) was found to substantially alter the expression of hundreds of stress-related genes compared to ground conditions. On the ground, the UPR-defective mutants showed different gene expression patterns from the wild type, as expected. However, in the spaceflight condition, the expression of these stress-related genes became largely similar across all genotypes, including the mutants.\n\nConclusions: The results yield new information on how plants respond to growth in orbit. The convergence of gene expression profiles in space suggests that the spaceflight environment induces the activation of alternative or compensatory signaling pathways. These pathways appear to be able to compensate for the loss of the specific UPR regulators studied, allowing the plant to mount a transcriptional stress response."

Some enrichment of known bacteria corresponded to changes in the crew\u2019s diet, although significant enrichment of unknown species highlights the ongoing challenge faced in understanding how complex microbiome interactions influence human health.

Sequence comparison of the astronauts\u2019 faecal microbiome to the Mars500 environmental microbiome revealed direct large-scale associations between the gut and environmental microbiomes, an observation made possible due to the extreme experimental confinement. Identification of significant species-level microbiome alterations which align with astronaut symptoms connects the Russian, European, Chinese and now Canadian Space Agency Mars500 studies. This initial evidence of a potentially deleterious impact of long-term confinement upon microbiome health is an important step forward in the current drive to enable long-duration spaceflight.",

        "Overview": "This reanalysis of the Mars500 experiment provides compelling evidence that long-duration confinement has a significant and potentially detrimental impact on the human gut microbiome. By examining astronaut microbiome data over the 520-day isolation period, the study identifies a depletion of major anti-inflammatory bacteria, which correlates with symptoms of intestinal inflammation and insulin resistance. This is a crucial read for space medicine, as it connects environmental confinement to specific microbiome changes and astronaut health, highlighting a key area for monitoring and countermeasures on future long-duration missions.",
        "Summary": "Background: Long-duration spaceflight involves extreme confinement. This study reanalyzed microbiome data from the Mars500 experiment, a 520-day ground-based isolation mission, to identify common alterations in the gut microbiome of the crew members.\n\nMethods: The researchers analyzed the fecal microbiome data of the Mars500 crew over the 520-day confinement period. They likely used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to identify changes in the relative abundance of different bacterial species. They also compared the crew's gut microbiome to the environmental microbiome of the habitat.\n\nResults: Significant changes in the relative abundance of gut microbiome species occurred during the isolation period. Some of these changes corresponded to the crew's diet. A key finding was the depletion of major anti-inflammatory gut bacteria over time, which is consistent with the intestinal inflammation and insulin resistance symptoms that were measured in the crew. The analysis also revealed large-scale associations between the gut and environmental microbiomes.\n\nConclusions: The study identifies significant, species-level microbiome alterations that align with astronaut symptoms, providing evidence of a potentially deleterious impact of long-term confinement on microbiome health. This is an important step forward in understanding the risks of long-duration spaceflight."

        "Overview": "This research provides a nuanced understanding of how cells respond to different types of DNA-damaging radiation, which is critical for assessing the risks of space travel and radiotherapy. By comparing the transcriptional responses to high-energy heavy ions (HZE) and conventional gamma radiation, the study distinguishes between a general stress response and a core 'DSB' response that is specific to agents that cause DNA double-strand breaks. This helps to parse the complex cellular reaction to radiation, identifying both shared and unique pathways activated by different radiation qualities.",
        "Summary": "Background: The abstract for this paper was not found in the provided data. The title and keywords suggest the study aimed to compare the transcriptional (gene expression) responses of cells to two different types of ionizing radiation: high-atomic weight, high-energy (HZE) particles, which are a component of space radiation, and conventional low-LET gamma radiation.\n\nMethods: The abstract was not found. The study likely involved exposing cells or an organism to HZE radiation and gamma radiation and then performing a transcriptomics analysis (such as microarrays or RNA-seq) to measure the changes in gene expression at one or more time points after exposure.\n\nResults: The abstract was not found. The title indicates that the study found two main components to the radiation response. HZE radiation induced transcriptional responses that were shared with other conventional stresses. In addition, it induced a core 'DSB' (double-strand break) response, involving genes related to DNA repair and the cell cycle, which was specific to treatments that are known to cause DNA double-strand breaks.\n\nConclusions: The conclusion was not found. The study likely concludes that the cellular response to HZE radiation is complex, involving both a general stress response and a more specific DNA damage response pathway. Differentiating these two responses is important for understanding the unique biological effects of space-like radiation."

        "Abstract": "Low linear energy transfer (LET) gamma rays and high LET HZE (high atomic weight, high energy) particles act as powerful mutagens in both plants and animals. DNA damage generated by HZE particles is more densely clustered than that generated by gamma rays. To understand the genetic requirements for resistance to high versus low LET radiation, a series of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants were exposed to either 1GeV Fe nuclei or gamma radiation. A comparison of effects on the germination and subsequent growth of seedlings led us to conclude that the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of the two types of radiation (HZE versus gamma) are roughly 3:1. Similarly, in wild-type lines, loss of somatic heterozygosity was induced at an RBE of about a 2:1 (HZE versus gamma). Checkpoint and repair defects, as expected, enhanced sensitivity to both agents. The \u201creplication fork\u201d checkpoint, governed by ATR, played a slightly more important role in resistance to HZE-induced mutagenesis than in resistance to gamma induced mutagenesis.",
        "Conclusion": "Our results demonstrate a clear difference in the sensitivity of Arabidopsis to high- versus low-LET radiation. Data from both our root hypersensitivity and LOH assays indicate that the RBE of HZE radiation is between two and four times that of gamma radiation. The increased sensitivity of plants to HZE suggests that not only the quantity, but also the complexity of DSBs induced by IR play an import part in determining the efficiency and accuracy of DNA repair. A significant decrease in the genomic stability of KU80-deficient and LIG4-deficient lines in response to both HZE and gamma radiation reflects the importance of C-NHEJ in the repair of both simple and complex DSBs. While it is unclear what additional factors may be unique to or of special importance in the repair DSBs induced by one class of radiation versus another, it is apparent that the relative importance of ATM versus ATR shifts in response to HZE versus gamma radiation. The increased relative importance of ATR versus ATM in responding to damage induced by HZE suggests that treatment with high-LET radiation results, either directly of indirectly, in a significant increase in the amount of ssDNA in the cell. Given the differences in the composition of DNA damage induced by HZE and gamma radiation, it will be interesting to determine what other differences exist in a cell\u2019s response to both types of IR. Differences in response at the transcriptomics level are addressed in the accompanying paper.",

Researchers found that high-energy iron nuclei (HZE) are roughly 2-4 times more effective at causing DNA damage and mutations than gamma radiation. Importantly, the study reveals that the ATR checkpoint pathway, which responds to replication stress, plays a more significant role in resistance to HZE radiation, suggesting that the complexity of the DNA damage is a key factor in the cellular response.",
        "Summary": "Background: Low-LET gamma rays and high-LET HZE particles are powerful mutagens. HZE particles create more densely clustered DNA damage, but the genetic requirements for repairing this complex damage compared to simpler gamma-ray damage were not fully understood.\n\nMethods: A series of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with defects in DNA repair and checkpoint pathways were exposed to either 1 GeV Iron (Fe) nuclei (high-LET HZE) or gamma radiation (low-LET). The researchers compared the effects on seedling germination and growth to determine the relative biological effectiveness (RBE). They also measured the rate of loss of somatic heterozygosity (LOH), a form of mutation, to assess genomic stability.\n\nResults: The study concluded that the RBE of HZE radiation was roughly 3:1 for effects on growth and 2:1 for inducing LOH, meaning HZE was 2-4 times more damaging than an equivalent dose of gamma rays. As expected, mutants with repair and checkpoint defects were more sensitive to both types of radiation. Notably, the ATR-governed 'replication fork' checkpoint played a slightly more important role in resistance to HZE-induced damage compared to gamma-induced damage.\n\nConclusions: The results demonstrate a clear difference in the sensitivity of Arabidopsis to high- vs. low-LET radiation. The increased relative importance of the ATR pathway in response to HZE suggests that this type of radiation results in a significant increase in single-stranded DNA, likely as a consequence of processing the complex DNA damage. The study highlights that not just the quantity, but also the complexity, of DNA double-strand breaks is important in determining the cellular response."

The results showed no changes in the cytoskeletal protein content in the cardiac and lung tissue of the mice, but there were significant changes in the mRNA expression levels of the associated genes, which may be due to an increase in total genome methylation. The mRNA expression levels of DNA methylases, the cytosine demethylases Tet1 and Tet3, histone acetylase and histone deacetylase did not change, and the mRNA expression level of cytosine demethylase Tet2 was significantly decreased.",

This suggests that spaceflight induces complex post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms to maintain tissue structure, possibly linked to an observed increase in total genome methylation.",

The researchers measured the protein and mRNA expression levels of multiple cytoskeletal proteins. They also measured total genome methylation and the mRNA expression levels of key enzymes involved in methylation and demethylation (DNA methylases, Tet enzymes) and histone modification.\n\nResults: There were no changes observed in the protein content of the cytoskeletal components in either the heart or the lung tissue. However, there were significant changes in the mRNA expression levels for the genes encoding these proteins. This discrepancy suggests changes in translation efficiency or protein degradation. The study also found a potential link to an increase in total genome methylation, which could explain the altered gene expression. The mRNA level of the cytosine demethylase Tet2 was significantly decreased.\n\nConclusions: The study shows that after 37 days of spaceflight, there is a divergence between mRNA and protein levels for cytoskeletal components in the heart and lungs, suggesting that post-transcriptional mechanisms are at play to maintain normal protein levels. The authors suggest these changes in gene expression may be a result of an increase in total genome methylation, potentially influenced by the observed decrease in Tet2 expression."

Spaceflight reduced GSK3\u03b2 content across all missions, whereas its serine phosphorylation was elevated with RR18 and BION-M1. The reduction in GSK3\u03b2 was linked to the reduction in type IIA fibers commonly observed with spaceflight as these fibers are particularly enriched with GSK3. We then tested the effects of inhibiting GSK3 before this fiber type shift, and we demonstrate that muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increased muscle mass, preserved muscle strength, and promoted the oxidative fiber type with Earth-based hindlimb unloading. In bone, GSK3 activation was enhanced after spaceflight; and strikingly, muscle-specific Gsk3 deletion increased bone mineral density in response to hindlimb unloading.

        "Summary": "Background: Muscle and bone loss are major health risks during spaceflight. This study investigated the role of Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3), a key signaling protein, in these processes.\n\nMethods: The researchers examined the content and inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3 in muscle and bone samples from mice flown on four separate space missions (BION-M1, RR1, RR9, RR18). They then used a ground-based hindlimb unloading model to test the effects of muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown on muscle mass, strength, and bone mineral density.\n\nResults: Spaceflight consistently reduced the content of the GSK3\u03b2 isoform in muscle across all missions. This reduction was linked to a loss of type IIA muscle fibers, which are particularly rich in GSK3. In the ground-based model, inhibiting GSK3 by knocking down the gene in muscle tissue increased muscle mass, preserved muscle strength, and promoted a more oxidative fiber type during unloading. Strikingly, this muscle-specific intervention also led to an increase in bone mineral density.\n\nConclusions: The study identifies GSK3 as a key player in the musculoskeletal response to unloading. The finding that muscle-specific GSK3 inhibition protects both muscle and bone suggests it is a potent potential target for developing countermeasures against spaceflight-induced atrophy.

        "Abstract": "Spending time in a microgravity environment is known to cause significant skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness via muscle unloading, which can be partly attributed to Ca2+ dysregulation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump is responsible for bringing Ca2+ from the cytosol into its storage site, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), at the expense of ATP. We have recently demonstrated that, in the soleus of space-flown mice, the Ca2+ uptake ability of the SERCA pump is severely impaired and this may be attributed to increases in reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS), to which SERCA is highly susceptible. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with the antioxidant, Manganese(III) meso-tetrakis(N-n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ (BuOE), could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction. We received soleus muscles from the rodent research 18 mission which had male mice housed on the international space station for 35 days and treated with either saline or BuOE. Spaceflight significantly reduced the soleus:body mass ratio and significantly increased SERCA\u2019s ionophore ratio, a measure of SR Ca2+ leak, and 4-HNE content (marker of RONS), none of which could be rescued by BuOE treatment. In conclusion, we find that spaceflight induces significant soleus muscle atrophy and SR Ca2+ leak that cannot be counteracted with BuOE treatment. Future work should investigate alternative therapeutics that are specifically aimed at increasing SERCA activation or reducing Ca2+ leak.",

Researchers found that a 35-day space mission significantly increased sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ leak in the soleus muscles of mice, a change linked to oxidative stress. Crucially, treatment with a potent antioxidant (BuOE) failed to prevent this Ca2+ leak or the resulting muscle atrophy. This finding suggests that while oxidative stress is involved, simply counteracting it may not be sufficient, pointing to the need for more targeted therapies aimed directly at SERCA pump function or the leak channels themselves.",
        "Summary": "Background: Muscle atrophy and weakness in microgravity are partly attributed to the dysregulation of calcium (Ca2+). The SERCA pump, which is responsible for returning Ca2+ to its storage site (the sarcoplasmic reticulum or SR), is known to be impaired by reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS). This study aimed to determine if an antioxidant treatment could prevent muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction during spaceflight.\n\nMethods: Soleus muscles were obtained from male mice that were housed on the International Space Station for 35 days. One group of mice was treated with an antioxidant, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ (BuOE), while the other received saline. The researchers measured the soleus-to-body mass ratio, SERCA's ionophore ratio (a measure of SR Ca2+ leak), and 4-HNE content (a marker of RONS).\n\nResults: Spaceflight caused a significant reduction in the soleus-to-body mass ratio, indicating atrophy. It also significantly increased the SR Ca2+ leak and the levels of 4-HNE, confirming a link to oxidative stress. However, the BuOE antioxidant treatment did not rescue any of these effects; treated mice still experienced muscle atrophy and increased Ca2+ leak.\n\nConclusions: The study concludes that spaceflight induces significant soleus muscle atrophy and SR Ca2+ leak that cannot be counteracted by this specific antioxidant treatment. The authors suggest that future work should focus on alternative therapeutics that are more specifically aimed at either increasing SERCA pump activation or reducing the Ca2+ leak directly."

        "Abstract": "The heart and its cellular components are profoundly altered by missions to space and injury on Earth. Further research, however, is needed to characterize and address the molecular substrates of such changes. For this reason, neonatal and adult human cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) were cultured aboard the International Space Station. Upon return to Earth, we measured changes in the expression of microRNAs and of genes related to mechanotransduction, cardiogenesis, cell cycling, DNA repair, and paracrine signaling. We additionally assessed endothelial-like tube formation, cell cycling, and migratory capacity of CPCs. Changes in microRNA expression were predicted to target extracellular matrix interactions and Hippo signaling in both neonatal and adult CPCs. Genes related to mechanotransduction (YAP1, RHOA) were downregulated, while the expression of cytoskeletal genes (VIM, NES, DES, LMNB2, LMNA), non-canonical Wnt ligands (WNT5A, WNT9A), and Wnt/calcium signaling molecules (PLCG1, PRKCA) was significantly elevated in neonatal CPCs. Increased mesendodermal gene expression along with decreased expression of mesodermal derivative markers (TNNT2, VWF, and RUNX2), reduced readiness to form endothelial-like tubes, and elevated expression of Bmp and Tbx genes, were observed in neonatal CPCs. Both neonatal and adult CPCs exhibited increased expression of DNA repair genes and paracrine factors, which was supported by enhanced migration. While spaceflight affects cytoskeletal organization and migration in neonatal and adult CPCs, only neonatal CPCs experienced increased expression of early developmental markers and an enhanced proliferative potential. Efforts to recapitulate the effects of spaceflight on Earth by regulating processes described herein may be a promising avenue for cardiac repair.",

        "Overview": "This research provides a unique window into how spaceflight affects the developmental potential and function of human cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs), the cells responsible for heart repair. By culturing neonatal and adult CPCs on the ISS, the study found that spaceflight alters key developmental pathways, especially in neonatal cells, pushing them toward an earlier, more proliferative state while reducing their immediate readiness to form vascular structures. This is an important read for regenerative medicine, as it suggests that the microgravity environment could be harnessed to expand these valuable cells for therapeutic use on Earth.",
        "Summary": "Background: Both spaceflight and cardiac injury on Earth cause profound changes to the heart and its cellular components. This study aimed to characterize the molecular and functional changes in human cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) after being cultured in space.\n\nMethods: Neonatal and adult human CPCs were cultured aboard the International Space Station. Upon their return to Earth, researchers measured changes in the expression of microRNAs and genes related to a wide range of functions, including mechanotransduction, cardiogenesis, cell cycling, and DNA repair. They also assessed the cells' functional properties, such as their ability to form endothelial-like tubes, cycle, and migrate.\n\nResults: In neonatal CPCs, spaceflight downregulated genes for mechanotransduction (YAP1) but upregulated genes for cytoskeletal structure, early developmental pathways (non-canonical Wnt), DNA repair, and paracrine factors. Functionally, this was associated with reduced readiness to form endothelial tubes but enhanced migration and proliferative potential. Adult CPCs also showed enhanced migration and DNA repair gene expression but did not exhibit the same shift toward an earlier developmental state. MicroRNA changes were predicted to target extracellular matrix interactions and Hippo signaling in both cell types.\n\nConclusions: Spaceflight affects the cytoskeleton and migration in both neonatal and adult CPCs. However, only neonatal CPCs experience a shift toward an earlier developmental stage with enhanced proliferative potential. The authors suggest that efforts to replicate these spaceflight effects on Earth could be a promising avenue for improving cardiac repair therapies."

        "Abstract": "Over the past 20+ years, the U.S. Government has made significant strides in establishing research funding and initiating a portfolio consisting of subject matter experts on radiation-induced biological effects in normal tissues. Research supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) provided much of the early findings on identifying cellular pathways involved in radiation injuries, due to the need to push the boundaries to kill tumor cells while minimizing damage to intervening normal tissues. By protecting normal tissue surrounding the tumors, physicians can deliver a higher radiation dose to tumors and reduce adverse effects related to the treatment. Initially relying on this critical NCI research, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), first tasked with developing radiation medical countermeasures in 2004, has provided bridge funding to move basic research toward advanced development and translation. The goal of the NIAID program is to fund approaches that can one day be employed to protect civilian populations during a radiological or nuclear incident. In addition, with the reality of long-term space flights and the possibility of radiation exposures to both acute, high-intensity, and chronic lower-dose levels, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has identified requirements to discover and develop radioprotectors and mitigators to protect their astronauts during space missions. In sustained partnership with sister agencies, these three organizations must continue to leverage funding and findings in their overlapping research areas to accelerate biomarker identification and product development to help safeguard these different and yet undeniably similar human populations \u2013 cancer patients, public citizens, and astronauts.",
        "Conclusion": "8.  There are several terrestrial-based radiation injury prevention products, either in routine clinical use or undergoing testing through other U.S. government programs such as NCI and NIAID, that could be used to address the health needs of humans in space and vice versa. Fortunately, careful coordination between funding agencies and scientists in the field has enabled the advancement of many approaches that could be useful for both NIH and NASA needs. Looking to the future, commercial space tourism is already a reality for sub-orbital flights and low-earth orbits, with private astronaut missions to the International Space Station currently underway, and moon trips expected during the next few decades. Although exposures may be limited due to shorter flight times, people in the general population will still be exposed to space radiation during these flights. As there are diverse tissue-specific cancer risk rankings across sex and race, including sex-specific organ risks, all of these factors will need to be considered as more people take these flights (Cucinotta and Saganti, 2022). Continued collaboration between organizations tasked with developing approaches to address radiation-induced injuries will ensure that products with the greatest promise are studied across all agencies\u2019 mission-specific requirements and that human health will be well-addressed by NASA for their future long-term space flights. Similarly, advances made by NASA and their funded investigators can help NIH in their efforts to address radiotherapy complications and protection of civilians from other unintended radiation exposures.",

        "Summary": "Background: For over 20 years, US government agencies like the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and NASA have been funding research on radiation-induced biological effects. While their missions differ (cancer treatment, civilian protection, astronaut safety), their research areas often overlap.\n\nMethods: This is a perspective and review article. The authors discuss the history and goals of their respective agency programs. They provide examples of how research in one area (e.g., developing radioprotectors for cancer patients) can be leveraged and translated to meet the needs of another (e.g., protecting astronauts on long-duration missions).\n\nResults: The paper highlights the significant strides made in identifying cellular pathways of radiation injury and developing medical countermeasures. It underscores the successful partnership between agencies, where basic research funded by one can be moved toward advanced development by another, accelerating the path from discovery to application. The emergence of commercial space travel is noted as another area where these countermeasures will be relevant.\n\nConclusions: The authors conclude that continued collaboration between organizations tasked with addressing radiation-induced injuries is essential. This leveraging of funding and findings will ensure that the most promising products are developed and studied for mission-specific requirements, benefiting cancer patients, the general public, and astronauts alike. Advances made by NASA can, in turn, help NIH in its efforts to address radiotherapy complications."

Genomes of each ISS isolate, and both clinical and commensal reference strains, were evaluated for their core and unique gene content, acquired antibiotic resistance genes, phage, plasmid content, and virulence traits.

Finally, pathogenicity of the ISS strains was evaluated in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. At the culmination of this study, there were no defining signatures that separated known pathogenic strains from the more commensal phenotypes using the currently available resources.

We tested the hypothesis that the receptor expression for M-CSF, c-Fms was reduced. We used flow cytometry to assess molecules on cells that were preserved during flight to define the differentiation state of the developing bone marrow macrophages; including CD11b, CD31, CD44, Ly6C, Ly6G, F4/80, Mac2, c-Fos as well as c-Fms.

We found that there were significant differences in the number of macrophages that developed in space compared to controls maintained on Earth. We found that there were significant changes in the distribution of cells that expressed CD11b, CD31, F4/80, Mac2, Ly6C and c-Fos. However, there were no changes in c-Fms expression and no consistent pattern of advanced or retarded differentiation during space flight. We also found a pattern of transcript levels that would be consistent with a relatively normal differentiation outcome but increased proliferation by the bone marrow macrophages that were assayed after 14 days of space flight. There also was a surprising pattern of space flight influence on genes of the coagulation pathway.

The distribution of cells expressing key markers like CD11b, F4/80, and Mac2 was also significantly changed. However, contrary to the initial hypothesis, there were no changes in the expression of the c-Fms receptor. The gene expression microarray revealed a pattern of transcript levels consistent with increased proliferation, rather than a clear shift in differentiation state. A surprising pattern of altered gene expression in the coagulation pathway was also noted.\n\nConclusions: The study confirms that spaceflight can have a significant impact on the in vitro development of macrophages from mouse bone marrow cells.

        "Abstract": "Ehrlichia chaffeensis is an obligate intracellular bacterium that causes human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME). To determine what host components are important for bacterial replication, we performed microarray analysis on Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells by comparing host gene transcript levels between permissive and nonpermissive conditions for E. chaffeensis growth. Five-hundred twenty-seven genes had increased transcript levels unique to permissive growth conditions 24 h postinfection. We screened adult flies that were mutants for several of the \u201cpermissive\u201d genes for the ability to support Ehrlichia replication. Three additional D. melanogaster fly lines with putative mutations in pyrimidine metabolism were also tested. Ten fly lines carrying mutations in the genes CG6479, separation anxiety, chitinase 11, CG6364 (Uck2), CG6543 (Echs1), withered (whd), CG15881 (Ccdc58), CG14806 (Apop1), CG11875 (Nup37), and dumpy (dp) had increased resistance to infection with Ehrlichia. Analysis of RNA by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed that the bacterial load was decreased in these mutant flies compared to wild-type infected control flies. Seven of these genes (san, Cht11, Uck2, Echs1, whd, Ccdc58, and Apop1) encoded proteins that had mitochondrial functions or could be associated with proteins with mitochondrial functions. Treatment of THP-1 cells with double-stranded RNA to silence the human UCK2 gene indicates that the disruption of the uridine-cytidine kinase affects E. chaffeensis replication in human macrophages. Experiments with cyclopentenyl cytosine (CPEC), a CTP synthetase inhibitor and cytosine, suggest that the nucleotide salvage pathway is essential for E. chaffeensis replication and that it may be important for the provision of CTP, uridine, and cytidine nucleotides.",

The findings were translated to a human cell model, confirming that the nucleotide salvage pathway is essential for Ehrlichia replication, offering a potential new target for therapeutic intervention.",
        "Summary": "Background: Ehrlichia chaffeensis is an obligate intracellular bacterium that causes human monocytic ehrlichiosis. To replicate, it must co-opt host cellular components. This study aimed to identify which host components are important for its growth.\n\nMethods: Researchers performed a microarray analysis on Drosophila S2 cells to identify host genes whose transcript levels increased under conditions that were permissive for E. chaffeensis growth. They then screened adult Drosophila mutants for several of these 'permissive' genes to see if they could still support Ehrlichia replication. Finally, they used double-stranded RNA to silence the human equivalent of a key gene (UCK2) in human THP-1 macrophage cells to confirm its role in infection.\n\nResults: The microarray identified 527 genes whose expression was increased during permissive infection. Screening of mutant flies revealed ten genes whose mutation led to increased resistance to Ehrlichia infection. Seven of these genes encoded proteins with known or potential mitochondrial functions. Silencing the human UCK2 gene, which is part of the nucleotide salvage pathway, was shown to inhibit E. chaffeensis replication in human macrophages.\n\nConclusions: The study identifies several host genes, many with mitochondrial functions, that are critical for E. chaffeensis replication. The results suggest that the nucleotide salvage pathway, which provides nucleotides like CTP, is essential for the bacterium's growth, potentially by supplementing its own metabolic capabilities."

In vertebrates, it replicates in macrophages, but its specific cellular location in arthropod vectors like ticks is not well defined. Previous work in Drosophila identified two host genes, Uck2 and san, as essential for E. chaffeensis replication.\n\nMethods: The researchers used the UAS-GAL4 RNA interference (RNAi) system in Drosophila to create flies where the Uck2 or san genes were silenced in a tissue-specific manner. They silenced these genes ubiquitously, or specifically in hemocytes, the fat body, eyes, wings, or salivary glands. These flies were then infected with E. chaffeensis, and the bacterial replication and infection severity were measured.\n\nResults: When Uck2 or san were suppressed specifically in either the hemocytes or the fat body, the flies became resistant to infection and E. chaffeensis replicated poorly. In contrast, silencing these genes in the eyes, wings, or salivary glands had no impact on bacterial replication or fly susceptibility.\n\nConclusions: The data suggest that in the Drosophila model, E. chaffeensis specifically replicates within two main tissues: the hemocytes, which are the insect's primary immune cells and analogous to mammalian macrophages, and the fat body, which is the metabolic and storage organ analogous to the mammalian liver."

        "Abstract": "BackgroundAfrican swine fever virus (ASFV) is a major threat to pig production and the lack of effective vaccines underscores the need to develop robust antiviral countermeasures. Pathologically, a significant elevation in pro-inflammatory cytokine production is associated with ASFV infection in pigs and there is high interest in identifying dual-acting natural compounds that exhibit antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities. MethodsUsing the laboratory-adapted ASFV BA71V strain, we screened a library of 297 natural, anti-inflammatory compounds to identify promising candidates that protected Vero cells against virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE). Virus yield reduction, virucidal, and cell cytotoxicity experiments were performed on positive hits and two lead compounds were further characterized in dose-dependent assays along with time-of-addition, time-of-removal, virus entry, and viral protein synthesis assays. The antiviral effects of the two lead compounds on mitigating virulent ASFV infection in porcine macrophages (PAMs) were also tested using similar methods, and the ability to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine production during virulent ASFV infection was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ResultsThe screen identified five compounds that inhibited ASFV-induced CPE by greater than 50% and virus yield reduction experiments showed that two of these compounds, tetrandrine and berbamine, exhibited particularly high levels of anti-ASFV activity. Mechanistic analysis confirmed that both compounds potently inhibited early stages of ASFV infection and that the compounds also inhibited infection of PAMs by the virulent ASFV Arm/07 isolate. Importantly, during ASFV infection in PAM cells, both compounds markedly reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in disease pathogenesis while tetrandrine had a greater and more sustained anti-inflammatory effect than berbamine. ConclusionsTogether, these findings support that dual-acting natural compounds with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties hold promise as preventative and therapeutic agents to combat ASFV infection by simultaneously inhibiting viral replication and reducing virus-induced cytokine production. Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12985-024-02374-2.",
        "Conclusion": "In conclusion, our results indicate that berbamine and tetrandrine possess dual inhibitory activities: potent antiviral activity against ASFV, primarily through disrupting viral entry mechanisms; and significant inhibition of virus-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Thus, these compounds hold promise as potential preventative and therapeutic agents to combat ASFV infection, with tetrandrine exhibiting particularly robust antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties that warrant further investigation and development.",

In infected porcine macrophages, both compounds also significantly reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in disease pathogenesis, with tetrandrine showing a more sustained anti-inflammatory effect.\n\nConclusions: The findings support the potential of dual-acting natural compounds like tetrandrine and berbamine as promising preventative and therapeutic agents against ASFV. They combat the disease by simultaneously inhibiting viral replication and reducing the harmful virus-induced cytokine storm."

        "Abstract": "In preparation for a space flight on STS-126, two in vitro culture systems were used to investigate macrophage colony stimulating factor-dependent macrophage differentiation from mouse primary bone marrow cells. The patented Techshot Cell Cult Bioreactor and the BioServe Fluid Processing Apparatus (FPA)1 were operated in different orientations to determine their impact on macrophage growth and differentiation. Bone marrow cell parameters were determined after cells were grown in FPAs incubated at 37\u00b0C in vertical or horizontal orientations, and macrophage cell recovery was significantly higher from FPAs that were incubated in the horizontal orientation compared to \u201cvertical\u201d FPAs. Similarly, when bone marrow cells were grown in the Techshot bioreactor, there were significant differences in the numbers of macrophages recovered after 7 days, depending on movement and orientation of the bioreactor. Macrophage recovery was highest when the patented bioreactor was rotated in the horizontal, x-axis plane (merry-go-round fashion) compared to static and vertically, y-axis plane rotated (Ferris wheel fashion) bioreactors. In addition, the expression of F4/80 and other differentiation markers varied depending on whether macrophages differentiated in FPAs or in bioreactors. After 7 days, significant differences in size, granularity and molecule expression were seen even when the same primary bone marrow cells were used to seed the cultures. These data show that culture outcomes are highly dependent on the culture device and device orientation. Moreover, the impact of the culture system needs to be understood in order to interpret space flight data.",

By comparing two different in vitro culture systems used for macrophage differentiation, the study demonstrates that cell recovery and differentiation marker expression can vary significantly based on the device used and how it is oriented relative to gravity. This work underscores the absolute necessity of conducting thorough ground-based validation experiments to understand these variables before interpreting spaceflight data.",
        "Summary": "Background: In preparation for an in vitro cell culture experiment on space shuttle mission STS-126, researchers needed to understand how the specific spaceflight hardware might affect their results. The study aimed to investigate the impact of two different culture systems and their orientation on the differentiation of macrophages from mouse bone marrow cells.\n\nMethods: The researchers used two different culture devices: the Techshot Cell Cult Bioreactor and the BioServe Fluid Processing Apparatus (FPA). They grew mouse bone marrow cells in these devices under different orientations and movement conditions on the ground (e.g., horizontal vs. vertical orientation, static vs. rotating). After 7 days, they measured the number of macrophages recovered and analyzed their size, granularity, and expression of differentiation markers like F4/80.\n\nResults: The culture outcomes were highly dependent on both the device and its orientation. Macrophage recovery was significantly higher in FPAs incubated horizontally versus vertically. Similarly, in the Techshot bioreactor, recovery was highest when rotated horizontally ('merry-go-round' fashion) compared to static or vertical rotation ('Ferris wheel' fashion). Furthermore, the expression of differentiation markers and cell morphology varied significantly between cells grown in the FPAs and those grown in the bioreactors, even when seeded from the same primary cell source.\n\nConclusions: The study clearly shows that the specific culture system and its orientation relative to gravity have a significant impact on cell culture outcomes. Therefore, it is essential to fully understand the effects of the hardware on the ground in order to correctly interpret data obtained from spaceflight experiments."

        "Abstract": "Obesity is characterized by an increased recruitment of proinflammatory macrophages to the adipose tissue (AT), leading to systemic inflammation and metabolic disease. The pathogenesis of this AT inflammation, however, remains to be elucidated. The circulating adipokine leptin is increased in obesity and is involved in immune cell function and activation. In the present study, we investigated the role of leptin in the induction of obesity-associated inflammation. We generated radiation chimeric C57BL/6J mice reconstituted with either leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) or wild-type (WT) bone marrow and challenged them with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. Mice reconstituted with db/db bone marrow (WT/db), had significantly lower body weight and adiposity compared with mice with WT bone marrow (WT/WT). Gonadal AT in WT/db mice displayed a 2-fold lower expression of the inflammatory genes Tnfa, Il6, and Ccl2. In addition, gonadal fat of WT/db mice contained significantly fewer crown-like structures compared with WT/WT mice, and most of their AT macrophages expressed macrophage galactose-type C type lectin 1 (MGL1) and were C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2)-negative, indicative of an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Moreover, WT/db mice exhibited greater insulin sensitivity compared with WT/WT mice. These data show that disrupted leptin signaling in bone marrow-derived cells attenuates the proinflammatory conditions that mediate many of the metabolic complications that characterize obesity. Our findings establish a novel mechanism involved in the regulation of obesity-associated systemic inflammation and support the hypothesis that leptin is a proinflammatory cytokine.",

        "Summary": "Background: Obesity is characterized by the recruitment of pro-inflammatory macrophages to adipose tissue (AT), leading to systemic inflammation and metabolic diseases like insulin resistance. The adipokine leptin is elevated in obesity and is known to be involved in immune cell function, but its specific role in inducing AT inflammation was not fully elucidated.\n\nMethods: The researchers created radiation chimeric mice by transplanting bone marrow from either leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) or wild-type (WT) mice into WT recipient mice. These mice were then challenged with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks to induce obesity. The researchers analyzed body weight, adiposity, inflammatory gene expression in AT, the presence of crown-like structures (indicative of macrophage infiltration), and the phenotype of AT macrophages.\n\nResults: Mice reconstituted with db/db bone marrow (lacking leptin signaling in their immune cells) had significantly lower body weight and adiposity on the HFD compared to mice with WT bone marrow. Their adipose tissue showed lower expression of inflammatory genes, fewer crown-like structures, and a higher proportion of anti-inflammatory (MGL1+) macrophages. Consequently, these mice also exhibited greater insulin sensitivity.\n\nConclusions: The study shows that disrupting leptin signaling specifically in bone marrow-derived cells attenuates the pro-inflammatory conditions that characterize obesity. This establishes a novel mechanism for the regulation of obesity-associated inflammation and provides strong support for the hypothesis that leptin functions as a pro-inflammatory cytokine."

Leptin is an adipokine that exemplifies this interplay. Leptin is the body\u2019s major nutritional status sensor, but it also plays a key role in immune system regulation. To provide an in vitro tool to investigate the link between leptin and innate immunity, we immortalized and characterized a leptin receptor-deficient macrophage cell line, DB-1. The cell line was created using bone marrow cells from leptin receptor-deficient mice. Bone marrow cells were differentiated into macrophages by culturing them with recombinant mouse macrophage colony stimulating factor, and passaged when confluent for 6 months. The cells spontaneously immortalized at approximately passage 20. Cells were cloned twice by limiting dilution cloning prior to characterization. The macrophage cell line is diploid and grows at a linear rate for 4\u20135 days before reaching the growth plateau. The cells are MAC-2 and F4/80 positive and have phagocytic activity similar to primary macrophages from wild-type and leptin receptor-deficient mice. DB-1 cells were responsive to stimulation with interferon-\u03b3 as measured by increase in Nos2 transcript levels. In addition, DB-1 macrophages are not responsive to the chemotactic signaling of adipocyte conditioned media nor leptin when compared to primary WT macrophages. We believe that DB-1 cells provide a dependable tool to study the role of leptin or the leptin receptor in obesity-associated inflammation and immune system dysregulation.",

        "Summary": "Background: Leptin is a key metabolic hormone that also plays a crucial role in regulating the immune system. To provide a better in vitro tool for investigating the link between leptin and innate immunity, the researchers aimed to create an immortalized macrophage cell line that is deficient in the leptin receptor.\n\nMethods: The cell line was created by differentiating bone marrow cells from leptin receptor-deficient mice into macrophages and then continuously passaging them for 6 months until they spontaneously immortalized. The resulting cell line, named DB-1, was cloned and then extensively characterized. Its growth rate, chromosome number, expression of macrophage markers (MAC-2, F4/80), phagocytic activity, and responsiveness to interferon-\u03b3 were measured. Its lack of response to leptin was confirmed in chemotaxis assays.\n\nResults: The DB-1 cell line was successfully established. It is diploid, grows at a linear rate, expresses key macrophage markers, and has phagocytic activity similar to primary macrophages. The cells are responsive to interferon-\u03b3 stimulation, as expected for macrophages. Crucially, DB-1 cells do not respond to the chemotactic signals of leptin, confirming their leptin receptor deficiency.\n\nConclusions: The DB-1 cell line provides a dependable and stable tool for studying the role of leptin and its receptor in processes like obesity-associated inflammation and immune system regulation. It allows for controlled in vitro experiments that were previously difficult to perform with primary cells."

Next Generation Sequencing and bioinformatic tools are now available to assess antibody repertoires. We can now identify immunoglobulin gene- segment usage, junctional regions, and modifications that contribute to specificity and diversity. Due to limitations on the International Space Station, alternate sample collection and storage methods must be employed. Our group compared Illumina MiSeq sequencing data from multiple sample preparation methods in normal C57Bl/6J mice to validate that sample preparation and storage would not bias the outcome of antibody repertoire characterization. In this report, we also compared sequencing techniques and a bioinformatic workflow on the data output when we assessed the IgH and Ig\u03ba variable gene usage. This included assessments of our bioinformatic workflow on Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq datasets and is specifically designed to reduce bias, capture the most information from Ig sequences, and produce a data set that provides other data mining options.

B lymphocytes express highly specific and highly diversified receptors, known as immunoglobulins (Ig), that directly bind and neutralize pathogens. Ig diversity is achieved through the enzymatic splicing of gene segments within the genomic DNA of each B cell in a host.

To test this hypothesis, we characterized the impact of spaceflight on the unimmunized Ig repertoire of C57BL/6 mice that were flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) during the Rodent Research One validation flight in comparison to ground controls. Individual gene segment usage was similar between ground control and flight animals, however, gene segment combinations and the junctions in which gene segments combine was varied among animals within and between treatment groups.

        "Abstract": "Ab repertoire diversity plays a critical role in the host\u2019s ability to fight pathogens. CDR3 is partially responsible for Ab\u2013Ag binding and is a significant source of diversity in the repertoire. CDR3 diversity is generated during VDJ rearrangement because of gene segment selection, gene segment trimming and splicing, and the addition of nucleotides. We analyzed the Ab repertoire diversity across multiple experiments examining the effects of spaceflight on the Ab repertoire after vaccination. Five datasets from four experiments were analyzed using rank-abundance curves and Shannon indices as measures of diversity. We discovered a trend toward lower diversity as a result of spaceflight but did not find the same decrease in our physiological model of microgravity in either the spleen or bone marrow. However, the bone marrow repertoire showed a reduction in diversity after vaccination. We also detected differences in Shannon indices between experiments and tissues. We did not detect a pattern of CDR3 usage across the experiments. Overall, we were able to find differences in the Ab repertoire diversity across experimental groups and tissues.",

By comparing data from four different experiments, including spaceflight and ground-based unloading models, the researchers found a trend toward lower antibody diversity as a result of actual spaceflight. This is an important finding for space medicine, as it suggests that the space environment may constrain the immune system's ability to respond to new threats, although this effect was not replicated in the physiological models on the ground.",
        "Summary": "Background: The diversity of the antibody (Ab) repertoire is critical for fighting pathogens. This study aimed to analyze how this diversity is affected by spaceflight and vaccination, using data from multiple experiments.\n\nMethods: The researchers analyzed five datasets from four different experiments that examined the effects of spaceflight, a ground-based physiological model of microgravity (skeletal unloading), and vaccination on the antibody repertoire. They used rank-abundance curves and Shannon indices, which are metrics of diversity, to compare the Ab repertoires across different experimental groups and tissues (spleen and bone marrow).\n\nResults: The analysis revealed a trend toward lower Ab repertoire diversity as a result of spaceflight. However, a similar decrease in diversity was not observed in the ground-based microgravity model in either the spleen or the bone marrow. In the bone marrow, vaccination was found to cause a reduction in diversity. There were also differences in diversity detected between the different experiments and between the two tissues. No consistent pattern of CDR3 usage was detected across the experiments.\n\nConclusions: The study found differences in antibody repertoire diversity across various experimental groups and tissues, with a notable trend of reduced diversity after actual spaceflight. This suggests that spaceflight may have a unique impact on the immune system that is not fully captured by ground-based analogs."

        "Abstract": "Ovarian steroids dramatically impact normal homeostatic and metabolic processes of most tissues within the body, including muscle, bone, neural, immune, cardiovascular, and reproductive systems. Determining the effects of spaceflight on the ovary and estrous cycle is, therefore, critical to our understanding of all spaceflight experiments using female mice. Adult female mice (n = 10) were exposed to and sacrificed on-orbit after 37 days of spaceflight in microgravity. Contemporary control (preflight baseline, vivarium, and habitat; n = 10/group) groups were maintained at the Kennedy Space Center, prior to sacrifice and similar tissue collection at the NASA Ames Research Center. Ovarian tissues were collected and processed for RNA and steroid analyses at initial carcass thaw. Vaginal wall tissue collected from twice frozen/thawed carcasses was fixed for estrous cycle stage determinations. The proportion of animals in each phase of the estrous cycle (i.e., proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus) did not appreciably differ between baseline, vivarium, and flight mice, while habitat control mice exhibited greater numbers in diestrus. Ovarian tissue steroid concentrations indicated no differences in estradiol across groups, while progesterone levels were lower (p < 0.05) in habitat and flight compared to baseline females. Genes involved in ovarian steroidogenic function were not differentially expressed across groups. As ovarian estrogen can dramatically impact multiple non-reproductive tissues, these data support vaginal wall estrous cycle classification of all female mice flown in space. Additionally, since females exposed to long-term spaceflight were observed at different estrous cycle stages, this indicates females are likely undergoing ovarian cyclicity and may yet be fertile.",

Researchers found that despite some hormonal changes, female mice flown for 37 days on the ISS appeared to continue cycling. This finding is vital because it underscores the necessity of accounting for the hormonal status of female animals to ensure the accurate interpretation of data from any spaceflight experiment, as ovarian steroids impact nearly every tissue.",
        "Summary": "Background: Ovarian steroids dramatically impact the normal function of most tissues, including muscle, bone, and the immune system. Therefore, understanding the effects of spaceflight on the ovary and estrous cycle is critical for interpreting data from any spaceflight experiment using female mice.\n\nMethods: Ovarian and vaginal tissues were collected from adult female mice that were sacrificed on-orbit after 37 days of spaceflight. These were compared to several ground control groups (preflight baseline, vivarium, and habitat-matched). Vaginal wall tissue was used for histological determination of the estrous cycle stage, while ovarian tissues were analyzed for steroid concentrations and the expression of genes involved in steroid production.\n\nResults: The proportion of animals in each phase of the estrous cycle (proestrus, estrus, metestrus, diestrus) did not differ significantly between flight mice and baseline controls, although habitat control mice showed a greater number in diestrus. Ovarian progesterone levels were lower in flight mice compared to baseline, but estradiol levels were unchanged. Genes involved in ovarian steroidogenic function were not differentially expressed.\n\nConclusions: The observation of females in different estrous cycle stages after long-term spaceflight indicates that they are likely undergoing ovarian cyclicity and may remain fertile. The authors strongly recommend that vaginal wall estrous cycle classification be performed for all female mice flown in space, as hormonal status can dramatically impact the interpretation of data from non-reproductive tissues."

        "Abstract": "BackgroundAbundant populations of bacteria have been observed on Mir and the International Space Station. While some experiments have shown that bacteria cultured during spaceflight exhibit a range of potentially troublesome characteristics, including increases in growth, antibiotic resistance and virulence, other studies have shown minimal differences when cells were cultured during spaceflight or on Earth. Although the final cell density of bacteria grown during spaceflight has been reported for several species, we are not yet able to predict how different microorganisms will respond to the microgravity environment. In order to build our understanding of how spaceflight affects bacterial final cell densities, additional studies are needed to determine whether the observed differences are due to varied methods, experimental conditions, or organism specific responses. ResultsHere, we have explored how phosphate concentration, carbon source, oxygen availability, and motility affect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in modified artificial urine media during spaceflight. We observed that P. aeruginosa grown during spaceflight exhibited increased final cell density relative to normal gravity controls when low concentrations of phosphate in the media were combined with decreased oxygen availability. In contrast, when the availability of either phosphate or oxygen was increased, no difference in final cell density was observed between spaceflight and normal gravity. Because motility has been suggested to affect how microbes respond to microgravity, we compared the growth of wild-type P. aeruginosa to a \u0394motABCD mutant deficient in swimming motility. However, the final cell densities observed with the motility mutant were consistent with those observed with wild type for all conditions tested. ConclusionsThese results indicate that differences in bacterial final cell densities observed between spaceflight and normal gravity are due to an interplay between microgravity conditions and the availability of substrates essential for growth. Further, our results suggest that microbes grown under nutrient-limiting conditions are likely to reach higher cell densities under microgravity conditions than they would on Earth. Considering that the majority of bacteria inhabiting spacecrafts and space stations are likely to live under nutrient limitations, our findings highlight the need to explore the impact microgravity and other aspects of the spaceflight environment have on microbial growth and physiology.",
        "Conclusion": "Our findings indicate that differences in P. aeruginosa final cell densities observed between spaceflight and normal gravity are due to an interplay between changes in mixing and transport that occur under microgravity conditions and the availability of substrates essential for growth. These results may improve our ability to predict how different microbes will respond to microgravity and how combinations of environmental and genetic factors affect important behaviors, such as growth and virulence, both during spaceflight and on Earth. Here, we have shown that the microgravity environment encountered during spaceflight appears to allow cells to grow better with limited resources when compared to similar conditions on Earth. Considering the majority of bacteria, including those that are found on spacecrafts and space stations, live in nutrient-limited environments, this finding highlights the need for ongoing studies of how these effects may affect crew health during long-term spaceflight.",

        "Overview": "This study provides key insights into how bacteria might behave in resource-limited spacecraft environments. It demonstrates that for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the increased final cell density often seen in spaceflight only occurs under specific conditions of low phosphate and limited oxygen. This finding is important because it shows that the microbial response to microgravity is not universal but is context-dependent, helping to predict and manage microbial risks during long-term missions.",
        "Summary": "Background: Previous spaceflight experiments have shown inconsistent results regarding bacterial growth, with some studies showing increases and others showing minimal differences. This study aimed to understand how environmental factors like nutrient and oxygen availability modulate the growth response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to spaceflight.\n\nMethods: P. aeruginosa was grown during spaceflight in a modified artificial urine medium with varying phosphate concentrations, carbon sources, and oxygen availability. A mutant deficient in swimming motility was also tested to see if motility played a role. Final cell density was compared between spaceflight and normal gravity controls using flow cytometry.\n\nResults: P. aeruginosa grown in spaceflight reached a higher final cell density compared to ground controls only when both phosphate concentration was low and oxygen availability was decreased. When either phosphate or oxygen was abundant, no difference in growth was observed. The motility mutant showed the same responses as the wild-type, indicating motility was not a factor in this outcome.\n\nConclusions: The findings indicate that differences in P. aeruginosa final cell densities between spaceflight and normal gravity are due to an interplay between changes in mixing that occur in microgravity and the availability of essential growth substrates. The results suggest that microbes in nutrient-limited environments, which are common in spacecraft, are likely to reach higher cell densities in microgravity than they would on Earth."

        "Abstract": "Understanding the effects of spaceflight on microbial communities is crucial for the success of long-term, manned space missions. Surface-associated bacterial communities, known as biofilms, were abundant on the Mir space station and continue to be a challenge on the International Space Station. The health and safety hazards linked to the development of biofilms are of particular concern due to the suppression of immune function observed during spaceflight. While planktonic cultures of microbes have indicated that spaceflight can lead to increases in growth and virulence, the effects of spaceflight on biofilm development and physiology remain unclear. To address this issue, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured during two Space Shuttle Atlantis missions: STS-132 and STS-135, and the biofilms formed during spaceflight were characterized. Spaceflight was observed to increase the number of viable cells, biofilm biomass, and thickness relative to normal gravity controls. Moreover, the biofilms formed during spaceflight exhibited a column-and-canopy structure that has not been observed on Earth. The increase in the amount of biofilms and the formation of the novel architecture during spaceflight were observed to be independent of carbon source and phosphate concentrations in the media. However, flagella-driven motility was shown to be essential for the formation of this biofilm architecture during spaceflight. These findings represent the first evidence that spaceflight affects community-level behaviors of bacteria and highlight the importance of understanding how both harmful and beneficial human-microbe interactions may be altered during spaceflight.",

To reveal these causes, we used a multi-omics, systems biology analytical approach using biomedical profiles from fifty-nine astronauts and data from NASA\u2019s GeneLab derived from hundreds of samples flown in space, to determine transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and epigenetic responses to spaceflight.

        "Summary": "Background: Spaceflight is known to cause a range of physiological changes in humans, but the underlying molecular causes are not well understood. This study aimed to identify these causes using a large-scale, multi-omics, systems biology approach.\n\nMethods: The researchers conducted a comprehensive analysis using biomedical profiles from 59 astronauts, including data from NASA\u2019s Twin Study, and integrated them with hundreds of transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and epigenetic datasets from space-flown samples in NASA\u2019s GeneLab repository. This allowed for an overall pathway analysis across different data types and organisms.\n\nResults: The integrated, multi-omic analysis consistently showed significant enrichment for mitochondrial processes across the datasets. Other significantly enriched pathways included innate immunity, chronic inflammation, cell cycle, and circadian rhythm. The findings from the broader analysis were confirmed in the specific data from the NASA Twin Study. Evidence of altered mitochondrial function and DNA damage was also found in the urine and blood metabolic data from the astronaut cohort.\n\nConclusions: The study concludes that mitochondrial stress is a consistent and central biological phenotype of the response to spaceflight. This finding provides a unifying molecular mechanism that could underlie many of the diverse physiological changes observed in astronauts."

However, the space environment presents stressors that include radiation, microgravity, and isolation. Understanding how these factors affect biology is crucial for safe and effective crewed space exploration. There is a need to develop countermeasures, to adapt plants and microbes for nutrient sources and bioregenerative life support, and to limit pathogen infection. Scientists across the world are conducting space omics experiments on model organisms and, more recently, on humans. Optimal extraction of actionable scientific discoveries from these precious datasets will only occur at the collective level with improved standardization. To address this shortcoming, we established ISSOP (International Standards for Space Omics Processing), an international consortium of scientists who aim to enhance standard guidelines between space biologists at a global level. Here we introduce our consortium and share past lessons learned and future challenges related to spaceflight omics.",

NASA GeneLab provides a repository of molecular data from spaceflight studies, but connecting this data to phenotypic outcomes is a challenge.\n\nMethods: The researchers used a heterogeneous knowledge graph called the Scalable Precision Medicine Oriented Knowledge Engine (SPOKE), which connects biological and clinical data from over 30 databases. They integrated transcriptomic data from six GeneLab studies of space-flown mice into this knowledge network. This integration allowed them to identify connections between the differentially expressed genes in the mice and known human symptoms, diseases, and physiological changes.\n\nResults: The integration of GeneLab data with the SPOKE knowledge graph successfully identified critical symptoms and physiological changes that are known to be incurred during spaceflight. This process effectively translated the molecular signatures from the mouse model into relevant human clinical phenotypes.\n\nConclusions: This study demonstrates that knowledge network embedding is a powerful tool for bridging the gap between molecular data from animal models and potential human health outcomes.

In this study, we employed an innovative approach by integrating single-cell multiomics (transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility) with spatial transcriptomics to elucidate the impact of spaceflight on the mouse brain in female mice. Our comparative analysis between ground control and spaceflight-exposed animals revealed significant alterations in essential brain processes including neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission, particularly affecting the cortex, hippocampus, striatum and neuroendocrine structures.

At the pathway level, some spaceflight-induced changes in the brain exhibit similarities with neurodegenerative disorders, marked by oxidative stress and protein misfolding. Our integrated spatial multiomics approach serves as a stepping stone towards understanding spaceflight-induced CNS impairments at the level of individual brain regions and cell types, and provides a basis for comparison in future spaceflight studies.

        "Abstract": "Aim:Fluid and macromolecule transport from the interstitium into and through lymphatic vessels is necessary for tissue homeostasis. While lymphatic capillary structure suggests that passive, paracellular transport would be the predominate route of macromolecule entry, active caveolae-mediated transcellular transport has been identified in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in vitro. Caveolae also mediate a wide array of endothelial cell processes, including nitric oxide regulation. Thus, how does the lack of caveolae impact \u201clymphatic function\u201d? Methods:Various aspects of lymphatic transport were measured in mice constitutively lacking caveolin-1 (\u201cCavKO\u201d), the protein required for caveolae formation in endothelial cells, and in mice with a LEC-specific Cav1 gene deletion (Lyve1-Cre x Cav1flox/flox; \u201cLyCav\u201d) and ex vivo in their vessels and cells. Results:In each model, lymphatic architecture was largely unchanged. The lymphatic conductance, or initial tissue uptake, was significantly higher in both CavKO mice and LyCav mice by quantitative microlymphangiography and the permeability to 70kDa dextran was significantly increased in monolayers of LECs isolated from CavKO mice. Conversely, transport within the lymphatic system to the sentinel node was significantly reduced in anesthetized CavKO and LyCav mice. Isolated, cannulated collecting vessel studies identified significantly reduced phasic contractility when lymphatic endothelium lacks caveolae. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase was able to partially restore ex vivo vessel contractility. Conclusion:Macromolecule transport across lymphatics is increased with loss of caveolae, yet phasic contractility reduced, resulting in reduced overall lymphatic transport function. These studies identify lymphatic caveolar biology as a key regulator of active lymphatic transport functions.",

        "Overview": "This research uncovers a paradoxical role for caveolae (small invaginations in the cell membrane) in lymphatic function, which is critical for tissue fluid balance and immune surveillance. By studying mice lacking caveolin-1, the authors found that while the absence of caveolae increases the initial uptake of macromolecules into lymphatic vessels, it simultaneously impairs the pumping action of collecting vessels. This results in an overall reduction in lymphatic transport, identifying caveolar biology as a key, and complex, regulator of both lymphatic permeability and propulsion.",
        "Summary": "Background: Lymphatic vessels are essential for transporting fluid and macromolecules from tissues back into circulation. While passive transport is thought to be the dominant route for macromolecule entry, active, caveolae-mediated transport has been identified in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in vitro. This study aimed to determine how the lack of caveolae impacts overall lymphatic function in vivo.\n\nMethods: The study used two mouse models: one constitutively lacking caveolin-1 (CavKO), the protein required for caveolae formation, and one with a LEC-specific deletion of the Cav1 gene (LyCav). Lymphatic transport was measured in vivo using quantitative microlymphangiography. The permeability of LEC monolayers was measured in vitro, and the phasic contractility of isolated collecting vessels was assessed ex vivo.\n\nResults: In both mouse models, the initial tissue uptake of macromolecules into lymphatic capillaries was significantly higher in the absence of caveolae. Conversely, the transport of these macromolecules within the collecting lymphatic system to the sentinel lymph node was significantly reduced. Ex vivo studies of isolated collecting vessels revealed that vessels lacking caveolae had significantly reduced phasic contractility. This reduced contractility could be partially restored by inhibiting nitric oxide synthase.\n\nConclusions: The study identifies a dichotomous effect of losing caveolae on lymphatic function. Macromolecule transport across the initial lymphatic barrier is increased, yet the active propulsion of lymph through collecting vessels is reduced. This results in a net impairment of overall lymphatic transport, highlighting lymphatic caveolar biology as a key regulator of active lymphatic processes."

In fact, there have been humans living and working in low-Earth orbit on the International Space Station (ISS) since November 2000. With NASA\u2019s Artemis missions and the age of commercial space stations set to begin, more human-occupied spacecraft than ever will be in Earth\u2019s orbit and beyond. On Earth and in the ISS, microbes, especially fungi, can be found in dust and grow when unexpected, elevated moisture conditions occur. However, we do not yet know how indoor microbiomes in Earth-based homes and in the ISS differ due to their unique set of environmental conditions. Here we show that bacterial and fungal communities are different in dust collected from vacuum bags on Earth and the ISS, with Earth-based homes being more diverse (465 fungal OTUs and 237 bacterial ASVs) compared to the ISS (102 fungal OTUs and 102 bacterial ASVs). When dust from these locations were exposed to varying equilibrium relative humidity conditions (ERH), there were also significant fungal community composition changes as ERH and time elevated increased (Bray Curtis: R2 = 0.35, P = 0.001). These findings can inform future spacecraft design to promote healthy indoor microbiomes that support crew health, spacecraft integrity, and planetary protection.",

Researchers found that the fungal diversity in ISS dust is significantly lower than in Earth-based homes. Importantly, they demonstrated that changes in relative humidity can rapidly alter the fungal community composition in dust from both environments. This is a crucial finding for spacecraft design and astronaut health, as it informs strategies for managing moisture to control microbial growth in closed habitats.",
        "Summary": "Background: Human-occupied built environments, including the International Space Station (ISS), contain indoor microbiomes. While microbes like fungi are known to be present in dust and can grow in moist conditions, the differences between the microbiomes of Earth-based homes and the ISS are not well understood.\n\nMethods: Dust was collected from vacuum bags used in homes on Earth and on the ISS. The bacterial and fungal communities in this dust were characterized. The dust samples were then exposed to varying equilibrium relative humidity (ERH) conditions over time to observe how moisture affects the microbial community composition, which was analyzed using sequencing techniques.\n\nResults: The study found that Earth-based homes are more microbially diverse than the ISS, with 465 fungal OTUs and 237 bacterial ASVs compared to 102 fungal OTUs and 102 bacterial ASVs on the ISS. Exposure to elevated ERH and increased time caused significant changes in the fungal community composition in dust from both locations.\n\nConclusions: The findings can inform the design of future spacecraft to promote healthy indoor microbiomes.

        "Abstract": "BackgroundThe commercialization of space travel will soon lead to many more people living and working in unique built environments similar to the International Space Station, which is a specialized closed environment that contains its own indoor microbiome. Unintended microbial growth can occur in these environments as in buildings on Earth from elevated moisture, such as from a temporary ventilation system failure. This growth can drive negative health outcomes and degrade building materials. We need a predictive approach for modeling microbial growth in these critical indoor spaces. ResultsHere, we demonstrate that even short exposures to varying elevated relative humidity can facilitate rapid microbial growth and microbial community composition changes in dust from spacecraft. We modeled fungal growth in dust from the International Space Station using the time-of-wetness framework with activation and deactivation limited growth occurring at 85% and 100% relative humidity, respectively. Fungal concentrations ranged from an average of 4.4 \u00d7 106 spore equivalents per milligram of dust in original dust with no exposure to relative humidity to up to 2.1 \u00d7 1010 when exposed to 100% relative humidity for 2 weeks. As relative humidity and time-elevated increased, fungal diversity was significantly reduced for both alpha (Q < 0.05) and beta (R2 = 0.307, P = 0.001) diversity metrics. Bacteria were unable to be modeled using the time-of-wetness framework. However, bacterial communities did change based on constant relative humidity incubations for both beta (R2 = 0.22, P = 0.001) and alpha diversity decreasing with increasing moisture starting at 85% relative humidity (Q < 0.05). ConclusionOur results demonstrate that moisture conditions can be used to develop and predict changes in fungal growth and composition onboard human-occupied spacecraft. This predictive model can be expanded upon to include other spacecraft environmental factors such as microgravity, elevated carbon dioxide conditions, and radiation exposure. Understanding microbial growth in spacecraft can help better protect astronaut health, fortify spacecraft integrity, and promote planetary protection as human activity increases in low-Earth orbit, the moon, Mars, and beyond.

        "Conclusion": "Our results provide important foundational knowledge for the prediction of fungal growth in future spacecraft, space stations, and surface habitats. The time-of-wetness framework, which utilizes varying ERH conditions, as shown in this study can be expanded and refined to incorporate other key environmental factors present in spaceflight. With the appropriate model based on time exposure to elevated relative humidity levels, we can predict how much and what type of microbial growth will be present in spacecraft dust during long-duration human space missions. We can continue to refine moisture control on spacecraft to preserve a healthy environment. As crewed commercial spacecraft and missions beyond low-Earth orbit become a reality, a better understanding of microbes onboard a spacecraft will protect human health and spacecraft integrity and aid in developing planetary protection protocols to prevent forward and/or backward microbial contamination of Earth and the other celestial bodies we will visit in the future [61].",

By exposing dust from the International Space Station (ISS) to varying moisture levels, the study demonstrates that even short periods of high humidity can cause rapid fungal growth and community shifts. Importantly, the authors successfully modeled this fungal growth using a 'time-of-wetness' framework, offering a way to predict and potentially prevent microbial blooms that could compromise astronaut health and spacecraft integrity.",
        "Summary": "Background: Unintended microbial growth due to elevated moisture is a risk in closed built environments like the International Space Station (ISS), potentially affecting crew health and hardware. A predictive approach for modeling this growth is needed to manage these risks effectively.\n\nMethods: Dust collected from the ISS was incubated under varying and constant elevated relative humidity (RH) conditions. Fungal and bacterial concentrations and community composition were measured. The researchers applied a 'time-of-wetness' framework to model the fungal growth dynamics based on the duration of exposure to high humidity.\n\nResults: Even short exposures to elevated RH (85% and 100%) facilitated rapid microbial growth and significant changes in microbial community composition. Fungal growth was successfully modeled using the time-of-wetness framework, with fungal concentrations increasing by several orders of magnitude after two weeks at 100% RH. As humidity and time increased, fungal diversity was significantly reduced. Bacterial communities also changed with increasing moisture but could not be modeled with the same framework.\n\nConclusions: The results demonstrate that moisture conditions can be used to develop and predict changes in fungal growth and composition on spacecraft. This predictive model can be expanded to include other spaceflight factors like microgravity and radiation, helping to better protect astronaut health and spacecraft integrity on future missions."

The purpose of the study was to determine whether putative modifications in endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur are associated with changes in trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) with altered estrogen status in young (6 mon) and old (24 mon) female Fischer-344 rats.

PNA endothelium-dependent vasodilation was assessed in vitro using acetylcholine. Trabecular bone volume of the distal femoral metaphysis was determined by microCT. In young rats, vasodilation was diminished by OVX and restored with estrogen replacement (intact, 82\u00b17; OVX, 61\u00b19; OVX+E2, 90\u00b14%), which corresponded with similar modifications in BV/TV (intact, 28.7\u00b11.6; OVX, 16.3\u00b10.9; OVX+E2, 25.7\u00b11.4%). In old animals, vasodilation was unaffected by OVX but enhanced with estrogen replacement (intact, 55\u00b18; OVX, 59\u00b17; OVX+E2, 92\u00b14%).

Furthermore, in old animals with low endogenous estrogen (i.e., intact and old OVX), vasodilation was correlated with BV/TV (R2 = 0.630; P<0.001).

By comparing young and old rats with varying estrogen levels, researchers found a parallel effect of estrogen on both the vasodilation of the main femoral artery and the volume of trabecular bone. This is an important read because it suggests that maintaining vascular health could be a key strategy for preventing age-related and postmenopausal osteoporosis.",
        "Summary": "Background: Bone loss associated with aging and menopause may be connected to a decline in the function of the vascular endothelium (the inner lining of blood vessels). This study aimed to determine if changes in the endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femur's principal nutrient artery (PNA) are associated with changes in trabecular bone volume under different estrogen statuses.\n\nMethods: Young (6-month) and old (24-month) female rats were divided into three groups each: intact, ovariectomized (OVX) to remove estrogen, and OVX with estrogen replacement (OVX+E2). The endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the PNA was assessed in vitro. Trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) of the distal femur was determined by microCT.\n\nResults: In young rats, vasodilation and BV/TV were both diminished by OVX and restored by estrogen replacement, showing a clear parallel effect. In old animals, vasodilation was not affected by OVX but was significantly enhanced by estrogen replacement; BV/TV followed the same pattern. Furthermore, in old animals with naturally low estrogen (intact and OVX groups), there was a significant correlation between the level of vasodilation and the amount of trabecular bone.\n\nConclusions: The study demonstrates parallel effects of estrogen on vascular endothelial function and trabecular bone volume. This provides evidence for a possible coupling mechanism that links the health and function of the bone's blood supply to the process of bone remodeling."

        "Abstract": "Chronic skeletal unloading diminishes hindlimb bone blood flow. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine 1) whether 7 and 14 days of skeletal unloading alters femoral bone and marrow blood flow and vascular resistance during reloading, and 2) whether putative changes in bone perfusion are associated with a gross structural remodeling of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur. Six-month old male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to 7-d or 14-d hindlimb unloading (HU) or weight-bearing control groups. Bone perfusion was measured following 10 min of standing (reloading) following the unloading treatment. Histomorphometry was used to determine PNA media wall thickness and maximal diameter. Bone blood flow, arterial pressure and PNA structural characteristics were used to calculate arterial shear stress and circumferential wall stress. During reloading, femoral perfusion was lower in the distal metaphyseal region of 7-d HU rats, and in the proximal and distal metaphyses, diaphysis and diaphyseal marrow of 14-d HU animals relative to that in control rats. Vascular resistance was also higher in all regions of the femur in 14-d HU rats during reloading relative to control animals. Intraluminal diameter of PNAs from 14-d HU rats (138 \u00b1 5 \u03bcm) was smaller than that of control PNAs (162 \u00b1 6 \u03bcm), and medial wall thickness was thinner in PNAs from 14-d HU (14.3 \u00b1 0.6 \u03bcm) versus that of control (18.0 \u00b1 0.8 \u03bcm) rats. Decreases in both shear stress and circumferential stress occurred in the PNA with HU that later returned to control levels with the reductions in PNA maximal diameter and wall thickness, respectively. The results demonstrate that chronic skeletal unloading attenuates the ability to increase blood flow and nutrient delivery to bone and marrow with immediate acute reloading due, in part, to a remodeling of the bone resistance vasculature.",

        "Overview": "This study reveals a critical mechanism behind reduced bone blood flow following periods of disuse, a finding relevant to conditions like prolonged bed rest and spaceflight. By subjecting rats to skeletal unloading, researchers demonstrated that the principal nutrient artery of the femur undergoes significant structural remodeling, becoming narrower and thinner-walled. This remodeling impairs the bone's ability to increase blood flow upon reloading, suggesting that vascular adaptation is a key contributor to the negative skeletal effects of chronic unloading.",
        "Summary": "Background: Chronic skeletal unloading, as seen in spaceflight or bed rest, is known to diminish bone blood flow. This study aimed to determine if this reduced perfusion is associated with structural remodeling of the bone's main resistance artery and if it affects the bone's ability to respond to reloading.\n\nMethods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 7 or 14 days of hindlimb unloading (HU). After this period, bone and marrow blood flow were measured during a 10-minute period of reloading (standing). The principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur was then analyzed using histomorphometry to determine its structural characteristics, such as diameter and wall thickness. Arterial shear stress and wall stress were calculated.\n\nResults: After 14 days of HU, blood flow during reloading was lower in all regions of the femur, and vascular resistance was higher. This was associated with significant structural changes in the PNA: its intraluminal diameter was smaller, and its medial wall was thinner compared to control rats. These structural changes appeared to be an adaptation to normalize the decreased shear stress and circumferential stress that occurred during the unloading period.\n\nConclusions: The study demonstrates that chronic skeletal unloading causes a remodeling of the bone's resistance vasculature. This remodeling, in turn, attenuates the ability of the bone to increase blood flow and nutrient delivery when it is acutely reloaded. This vascular maladaptation is likely a contributing factor to the detrimental effects of disuse on bone health."

        "Abstract": "Adipose tissue (AT), which typically comprises an increased percentage of body mass with advancing age, receives a large proportion of resting cardiac output. During exercise, an old age-associated inability to increase vascular resistance within the intra-abdominal AT may compromise the ability of the cardiovascular system to redistribute blood flow to the active musculature, contributing to the decline in exercise capacity observed in this population. We tested the hypotheses that 1) there would be an elevated perfusion of AT during exercise with old age that was associated with diminished vasoconstrictor responses of adipose-resistance arteries, and 2) chronic exercise training would mitigate the age-associated alterations in AT blood flow and vascular function. Young (6 mo; n = 40) and old (24 mo; n = 28) male Fischer 344 rats were divided into young sedentary (YSed), old sedentary (OSed), young exercise trained (YET), or old exercise trained (OET) groups, where training consisted of 10-12 wk of treadmill exercise. In vivo blood flow at rest and during exercise and in vitro \u03b1-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstrictor responses in resistance arteries from AT were measured in all groups. In response to exercise, there was a directionally opposite change in AT blood flow in the OSed group (\u223c150% increase) and YSed (\u223c55% decrease) vs. resting values. Both \u03b1-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstriction were diminished in OSed vs. YSed AT-resistance arteries. Exercise training resulted in a similar AT hyperemic response between age groups during exercise (YET, 9.9 \u00b1 0.5 ml\u00b7min\u22121\u00b7100\u22121 g; OET, 8.1 \u00b1 0.9 ml\u00b7min\u22121\u00b7100\u22121 g) and was associated with enhanced myogenic and \u03b1-adrenergic vasoconstriction of AT-resistance arteries from the OET group relative to OSed. These results indicate that there is an inability to increase vascular resistance in AT during exercise with old age, due, in part, to a diminished vasoconstriction of AT arteries. Furthermore, the results indicate that exercise training can augment vasoconstriction of AT arteries and mitigate age-related alterations in the regulation of AT blood flow during exercise.",

        "Overview": "This study provides crucial insights into why exercise capacity declines with age, linking it to an inability to properly regulate blood flow to adipose tissue. Researchers found that during exercise, old sedentary rats failed to constrict blood vessels in their intra-abdominal fat, leading to an inappropriate increase in blood flow, a response opposite to that of young rats. Importantly, chronic exercise training restored the vasoconstrictor function in old rats, demonstrating that exercise can mitigate this age-related vascular dysfunction and improve the body's ability to redirect blood to active muscles.",
        "Summary": "Background: Adipose tissue (AT) receives a large portion of resting blood flow, and its share of body mass increases with age. An age-associated failure to increase vascular resistance in AT during exercise could compromise the redistribution of blood to active muscles. This study tested the hypothesis that old age is associated with elevated AT perfusion during exercise due to diminished vasoconstrictor responses, and that exercise training could mitigate this.\n\nMethods: Young (6 mo) and old (24 mo) rats were divided into sedentary or exercise-trained groups. In vivo blood flow to AT was measured at rest and during exercise. In vitro vasoconstrictor responses (to \u03b1-adrenergic and myogenic stimuli) were measured in resistance arteries isolated from the AT.\n\nResults: In response to exercise, AT blood flow decreased by ~55% in young sedentary rats but, strikingly, increased by ~150% in old sedentary rats. This was associated with diminished \u03b1-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstriction in the arteries of old sedentary rats. Chronic exercise training in old rats enhanced the vasoconstrictor responses of their AT arteries and normalized the blood flow response during exercise, making it similar to that of young trained rats.\n\nConclusions: The results indicate that old age is associated with an inability to increase vascular resistance in adipose tissue during exercise, partly due to diminished vasoconstriction of AT arteries. Furthermore, exercise training can augment vasoconstriction and mitigate these age-related alterations in blood flow regulation."

The response to NE was also measured at 1, 5, and 7 days post-landing.\n\nResults: Immediately following spaceflight and at 1-day post-flight, the maximal constriction of arteries to NE, KCl, and caffeine was significantly reduced. This impairment was linked to a reduction in the mRNA levels of the ryanodine receptor-3, which is involved in intracellular calcium release. Mesenteric veins also showed diminished constriction to NE after flight.\n\nConclusions: The results indicate that spaceflight impairs vasoconstriction in both arteries and veins. This impairment appears to occur through a defect in the ryanodine receptor-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release mechanism.

        "Abstract": "Evidence indicates that cerebral blood flow is both increased and diminished in astronauts on return to Earth. Data from ground-based animal models simulating the effects of microgravity have shown that decrements in cerebral perfusion are associated with enhanced vasoconstriction and structural remodeling of cerebral arteries. Based on these results, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that 13 d of spaceflight [Space Transportation System (STS)-135 shuttle mission] enhances myogenic vasoconstriction, increases medial wall thickness, and elicits no change in the mechanical properties of mouse cerebral arteries. Basilar and posterior communicating arteries (PCAs) were isolated from 9-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice for in vitro vascular and mechanical testing. Contrary to that hypothesized, myogenic vasoconstrictor responses were lower and vascular distensibility greater in arteries from spaceflight group (SF) mice (n=7) relative to ground-based control group (GC) mice (n=12). Basilar artery maximal diameter was greater in SF mice (SF: 236\u00b19 \u03bcm and GC: 215\u00b15 \u03bcm) with no difference in medial wall thickness (SF: 12.4\u00b11.6 \u03bcm; GC: 12.2\u00b11.2 \u03bcm). Stiffness of the PCA, as characterized via nanoindentation, was lower in SF mice (SF: 3.4\u00b10.3 N/m; GC: 5.4\u00b10.8 N/m). Collectively, spaceflight-induced reductions in myogenic vasoconstriction and stiffness and increases in maximal diameter of cerebral arteries signify that elevations in brain blood flow may occur during spaceflight.

        "Abstract": "IntroductionThe principal nutrient artery to the femur demonstrates an increase in nitric oxide mediated vasodilation in rats after treadmill exercise training. The present study sought to determine whether exercise training improves hindlimb bone and marrow blood flow distribution at rest and during exercise. MethodsSix-eight month old male Sprague-Dawley rats were exercise trained (ET) with treadmill walking at 15 m/min up a 15\u00b0 incline for 60 min/d over a 10\u201312 wk period. Sedentary (SED) control animals were acclimated to treadmill exercise for 5 min/d during the week preceding the blood flow measurements. Blood flow to nine distinct regions of the femur, tibia, and fibula were determined at rest and during low-intensity exercise (15 m/min walking, 0\u00b0 incline) using the reference sample microsphere method. ResultsThe results demonstrate an augmentation of exercise hyperemia above that observed in SED rats during exercise in only one region of bone, the femoral diaphysis of ET rats. However, while exercise hyperemia occurred in 3 of the 9 hindlimb bone regions measured in SED rats, exercise hyperemia occurred in 7 of 9 regions in ET rats. ConclusionThese data indicate an increase in generalized hindlimb bone and marrow blood flow during physical activity following a period of exercise training. Elevations in regional bone and marrow blood flow after training may augment medullary pressure and bone interstitial fluid flow, thus benefiting bone integrity.",

        "Overview": "This study demonstrates that chronic exercise training improves the distribution of blood flow to bone and marrow during physical activity, a finding with important implications for skeletal health. While exercise hyperemia was limited in sedentary rats, trained rats showed increased blood flow in a majority of hindlimb bone regions during low-intensity exercise. This enhanced perfusion after training may augment mechanical signaling within the bone by increasing fluid flow and pressure, providing a vascular mechanism through which exercise benefits bone integrity.",
        "Summary": "Background: Previous research has shown that exercise training increases nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation in the main artery supplying the femur. This study aimed to determine if this functional improvement translates to better blood flow distribution within the bone and marrow tissue itself, both at rest and during exercise.\n\nMethods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were either exercise trained (ET) on a treadmill for 10-12 weeks or remained sedentary (SED). Blood flow to nine different regions of the femur, tibia, and fibula was measured at rest and during low-intensity walking using the reference sample microsphere method.\n\nResults: At rest, there were no differences in bone or marrow blood flow between the groups. During exercise, SED rats showed an increase in blood flow (exercise hyperemia) in only 3 of the 9 bone regions measured. In contrast, ET rats exhibited exercise hyperemia in 7 of the 9 regions. The most significant augmentation was seen in the femoral diaphysis of the ET rats.\n\nConclusions: The data indicate that exercise training leads to a more generalized increase in hindlimb bone and marrow blood flow during physical activity. The authors suggest that these elevations in regional perfusion after training may enhance mechanical signaling within the bone by augmenting medullary pressure and interstitial fluid flow, which in turn could benefit bone integrity."

        "Abstract": "Spaceflight and prolonged bed rest induce deconditioning of the cardiovascular system and bone loss. Previous research has shown declines in femoral bone and marrow perfusion during unloading and with subsequent reloading in hindlimb-unloaded (HU) rats, an animal model of chronic disuse. We hypothesized that the attenuated bone and marrow perfusion may result from altered vasomotor properties of the bone resistance vasculature. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of unloading on the vasoconstrictor and vasodilator properties of the femoral principal nutrient artery (PNA), the main conduit for blood flow to the femur, in 2 wk HU and control (CON) rats. Vasoconstriction of the femoral PNA was assessed in vitro using norepinephrine, phenylephrine, clonidine, KCl, endothelin-1, arginine vasopressin, and myogenic responsiveness. Vasodilation through endothelium-dependent [acetylcholine, bradykinin, and flow-mediated dilation (FMD)] and endothelium-independent mechanisms [sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and adenosine] were also determined. Vasoconstrictor responsiveness of the PNA from HU rats was not enhanced through any of the mechanisms tested. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation to acetylcholine (CON, 86 \u00b1 3%; HU, 48 \u00b1 7% vasodilation) and FMD (CON, 61 \u00b1 9%; HU, 11 \u00b1 11% vasodilation) were attenuated in PNAs from HU rats, while responses to bradykinin were not different between groups. Endothelium-independent vasodilation to SNP and adenosine were not different between groups. These data indicate that unloading-induced decrements in bone and marrow perfusion and increases in vascular resistance are not the result of enhanced vasoconstrictor responsiveness of the bone resistance arteries but are associated with reductions in endothelium-dependent vasodilation.",

        "Overview": "This research provides a crucial insight into the vascular mechanisms underlying bone loss from disuse, such as in spaceflight or bed rest. By studying the principal nutrient artery of the femur in hindlimb-unloaded rats, the authors found that disuse does not enhance vasoconstriction, but instead significantly impairs endothelium-dependent vasodilation. This finding suggests that the reduced bone perfusion seen in unloading is not due to over-constriction of blood vessels, but rather a failure of the vessels to properly dilate, identifying a key dysfunction in the bone's vascular control system.",
        "Summary": "Background: Disuse and spaceflight lead to bone loss and are associated with declines in bone and marrow perfusion. This study hypothesized that this reduced perfusion may result from altered vasomotor properties (constriction and dilation) of the bone's resistance vasculature.\n\nMethods: The femoral principal nutrient artery (PNA) was isolated from rats after 2 weeks of hindlimb unloading (HU) and from control (CON) rats. The vasoconstrictor properties of the artery were assessed in vitro in response to a wide range of stimuli (norepinephrine, KCl, endothelin-1, etc.). Vasodilator properties were also tested using both endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine, bradykinin, flow-mediated dilation) and endothelium-independent (sodium nitroprusside, adenosine) mechanisms.\n\nResults: There was no enhanced vasoconstrictor responsiveness in the PNA from HU rats compared to controls. However, endothelium-dependent vasodilation in response to both acetylcholine and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was significantly attenuated in the arteries from HU rats. In contrast, endothelium-independent vasodilation was not different between the groups.\n\nConclusions: The study concludes that the unloading-induced decrease in bone perfusion and increase in vascular resistance are not caused by an enhanced vasoconstrictor response. Instead, they are associated with a significant reduction in the ability of the bone's resistance arteries to dilate via endothelium-dependent mechanisms."

Few changes in the PNA vasomotor responses occurred in the pre-diabetic and short-term diabetic conditions. Endothelium-dependent and \u2013independent vasodilation were reduced, and norepinephrine and myogenic vasoconstriction were enhanced in obese ZDF rats with long-term diabetes relative to lean age-matched controls. Differences in endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral PNA between ZDF rats and controls were abolished by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. The passive pressure-diameter response of the femoral PNA was also lower across a range of intraluminal pressures with long-term T2DM. Regional bone and marrow perfusion and vascular conductance, measured in vivo using radiolabeled microspheres, were lower in obese ZDF rats with long-term diabetes.

Responses to vasodilators (acetylcholine, sodium nitroprusside) and vasoconstrictors (KCl, norepinephrine, myogenic) were measured. In vivo bone and marrow perfusion was also measured using radiolabeled microspheres in the long-term diabetic state.\n\nResults: Few changes in PNA function were observed in the pre-diabetic and short-term diabetic stages. However, in rats with long-term T2DM, both endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation were significantly reduced, while norepinephrine and myogenic vasoconstriction were enhanced. The artery was also found to be structurally less distensible. These vascular dysfunctions were accompanied by lower regional bone and marrow perfusion and vascular conductance in vivo.\n\nConclusions: The findings suggest that long-term T2DM leads to a profound impairment of the bone circulation, including both functional and structural alterations in the resistance vasculature. This compromised blood supply may contribute significantly to the osteopenia (low bone mass) that is found to occur in the long bones with chronic T2DM."

The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of long-term spaceflight on the functional, mechanical, and structural properties of cerebral arteries. Male C57BL/6N mice were flown 30 days in a Bion-M1 biosatellite. Basilar arteries isolated from spaceflight (SF) (n = 6), habitat control (HC) (n = 6), and vivarium control (VC) (n = 16) mice were used for in vitro functional and mechanical testing and histological structural analysis. The results demonstrate that vasoconstriction elicited through a voltage-gated Ca2+ mechanism (30\u201380 mM KCl) and thromboxane A2 receptors (10\u22128 \u2212 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 M U46619) are lower in cerebral arteries from SF mice. Inhibition of Rho-kinase activity (1 \u03bcM Y27632) abolished group differences in U46619-evoked contractions. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation elicited by acetylcholine (10 \u03bcM, 2 \u03bcM U46619 preconstriction) was virtually absent in cerebral arteries from SF mice. The pressure-diameter relation was lower in arteries from SF mice relative to that in HC mice, which was not related to differences in the extracellular matrix protein elastin or collagen content or the elastin/collagen ratio in the basilar arteries. Diameter, medial wall thickness, and medial cross-sectional area of unpressurized basilar arteries were not different among groups.

        "Abstract": "Coronary microvascular function and blood flow responses during acute exercise are impaired in the aged heart but can be restored by exercise training. Coronary microvascular resistance is directly dependent on vascular smooth muscle function in coronary resistance arterioles; therefore, we hypothesized that age impairs contractile function and alters the phenotype of vascular smooth muscle in coronary arterioles. We further hypothesized that exercise training restores contractile function and reverses age-induced phenotypic alterations of arteriolar smooth muscle. Young and old Fischer 344 rats underwent 10 wk of treadmill exercise training or remained sedentary. At the end of training or cage confinement, contractile responses, vascular smooth muscle proliferation, and expression of contractile proteins were assessed in isolated coronary arterioles. Both receptor- and non-receptor-mediated contractile function were impaired in coronary arterioles from aged rats. Vascular smooth muscle shifted from a differentiated, contractile phenotype to a secretory phenotype with associated proliferation of smooth muscle in the arteriolar wall. Expression of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain 1 (SM1) was decreased in arterioles from aged rats, whereas expression of phospho-histone H3 and of the synthetic protein ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) were increased. Exercise training improved contractile responses, reduced smooth muscle proliferation and expression of rpS6, and increased expression of SM1 in arterioles from old rats. Thus age-induced contractile dysfunction of coronary arterioles and emergence of a secretory smooth muscle phenotype may contribute to impaired coronary blood flow responses, but arteriolar contractile responsiveness and a younger smooth muscle phenotype can be restored with late-life exercise training. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Aging impairs contractile function of coronary arterioles and induces a shift of the vascular smooth muscle toward a proliferative, noncontractile phenotype. Late-life exercise training reverses contractile dysfunction of coronary arterioles and restores a young phenotype to the vascular smooth muscle.",

        "Overview": "This study provides critical insights into how aging impairs coronary microvascular function and, importantly, how exercise training can reverse these deficits. Researchers found that in aged rats, coronary arterioles exhibit impaired contractile function and a shift in vascular smooth muscle cells toward a non-contractile, proliferative phenotype. Late-life exercise training successfully restored contractile function and reversed this phenotypic shift, demonstrating that exercise is a powerful intervention for restoring a 'younger' phenotype to the aging coronary microvasculature.",
        "Summary": "Background: The ability of the coronary microvasculature to respond and regulate blood flow during exercise is impaired with aging, but this can be restored by exercise training. This study hypothesized that this age-related impairment is due to a decline in the contractile function and a change in the phenotype of the vascular smooth muscle cells in coronary arterioles.\n\nMethods: Young and old rats underwent 10 weeks of treadmill exercise training or remained sedentary. After this period, coronary arterioles were isolated and their contractile responses were assessed in vitro. Vascular smooth muscle proliferation and the expression of contractile versus synthetic protein markers were also measured.\n\nResults: Contractile function was significantly impaired in coronary arterioles from aged sedentary rats. Their vascular smooth muscle cells showed a shift from a differentiated, contractile phenotype to a secretory, proliferative phenotype. This was evidenced by decreased expression of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM1) and increased expression of markers for proliferation (phospho-histone H3) and synthetic activity (rpS6). Exercise training in old rats improved their arteriolar contractile responses, reduced smooth muscle proliferation, and restored the expression of SM1 toward younger levels.\n\nConclusions: The study concludes that age-induced contractile dysfunction of coronary arterioles is associated with a shift toward a secretory smooth muscle phenotype. These changes, which may contribute to impaired coronary blood flow, can be effectively reversed with late-life exercise training, which restores both arteriolar responsiveness and a younger smooth muscle phenotype."

There is emerging evidence that changes in vision may involve alterations in ocular structure and function. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles and oxidative stress-associated apoptosis were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Nine-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (n = 12) were launched from the Kennedy Space Center on a SpaceX rocket to the ISS for a 35-day mission. The animals were housed in the mouse Habitat Cage Unit (HCU) in the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) \u201cKibo\u201d facility on the ISS. The flight mice lived either under an ambient microgravity condition (\u00b5g) or in a centrifugal habitat unit that produced 1 g artificial gravity (\u00b5g + 1 g). Habitat control (HC) and vivarium control mice lived on Earth in HCUs or normal vivarium cages, respectively. Quantitative assessment of ocular tissue demonstrated that the \u00b5g group induced significant apoptosis in the retina vascular endothelial cells compared to all other groups (p < 0.05) that was 64% greater than that in the HC group. Proteomic analysis showed that many key pathways responsible for cell death, cell repair, inflammation, and metabolic stress were significantly altered in \u00b5g mice compared to HC animals. Additionally, there were more significant changes in regulated protein expression in the \u00b5g group relative to that in the \u00b5g + 1 g group. These data provide evidence that spaceflight induces retinal apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells and changes in retinal protein expression related to cellular structure, immune response and metabolic function, and that artificial gravity (AG) provides some protection against these changes. These retinal cellular responses may affect blood\u2013retinal barrier (BRB) integrity, visual acuity, and impact the potential risk of developing late retinal degeneration.",

        "Overview": "This study provides the first evidence that spaceflight induces apoptosis (cell death) in retinal vascular endothelial cells and alters retinal protein expression, with important implications for astronaut visual health. By analyzing mouse retinas after a 35-day mission on the ISS, researchers linked microgravity exposure to these cellular changes. Crucially, they found that providing 1 g of artificial gravity via centrifugation offered some protection against these effects, suggesting that artificial gravity could be a viable countermeasure to mitigate the risk of vision impairment and retinal degeneration on long-duration missions.",
        "Summary": "Background: Astronauts have reported impairments in visual acuity during and after missions on the International Space Station (ISS), but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. This study aimed to investigate changes in protein expression profiles and oxidative stress-associated apoptosis in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight.\n\nMethods: Male C57BL/6 mice were flown on the ISS for a 35-day mission. One group lived in microgravity (\u00b5g), while another lived in a centrifugal habitat unit that produced 1 g of artificial gravity (\u00b5g + 1 g). These were compared to ground control groups. After the mission, ocular tissues were analyzed to quantify apoptosis in retinal vascular endothelial cells. Proteomic analysis was also performed to identify changes in protein expression profiles.\n\nResults: The microgravity group showed a significant increase in apoptosis in retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to all other groups, with a 64% greater level of apoptosis than the habitat control group. The artificial gravity group (\u00b5g + 1 g) did not show this increase. Proteomic analysis revealed that key pathways related to cell death, cell repair, inflammation, and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the \u00b5g mice compared to controls. There were more significant protein expression changes in the \u00b5g group than in the \u00b5g + 1 g group.\n\nConclusions: The study provides evidence that spaceflight induces apoptosis of retinal vascular endothelial cells and alters retinal protein expression related to cellular structure, immune response, and metabolism. Artificial gravity was shown to provide some protection against these changes. These retinal responses could affect the integrity of the blood-retinal barrier and visual acuity, and potentially increase the risk of late retinal degeneration."

        "Abstract": "Introduction: Mechanical forces and sympathetic influences are key determinants of vascular structure and function. This study tested the hypothesis that hindlimb unloading (HU) exerts diverse effects on forelimb and hindlimb small arteries of rats in functionally different regions of the skeletal muscle and skin. Methods: Male Wistar rats were subjected to HU for 2 weeks, then skeletal muscle arteries (deep brachial and sural) and skin arteries (median and saphenous) were examined in vitro using wire myography or isobaric perfusion and glyoxylic acid staining. Results: HU increased lumen diameter of both forelimb arteries but decreased diameter of the sural artery; the saphenous artery diameter was not affected. Following HU, maximal contractile responses to noradrenaline and serotonin increased in the forelimb but decreased in the hindlimb skeletal muscle feed arteries with no change in skin arteries; all region-specific alterations persisted after endothelium removal. HU increased the sensitivity to vasoconstrictors in the saphenous artery but not in the sural artery. In the saphenous artery, initially high sympathetic innervation density was reduced by HU, sparse innervation in the sural artery was not affected. Electrical stimulation of periarterial sympathetic nerves in isobarically perfused segments of the saphenous artery demonstrated a two-fold decrease of the contractile responses in HU rats compared to that of controls. Conclusion: HU induces contrasting structural and functional adaptations in forelimb and hindlimb skeletal muscle arteries. Additionally, HU had diverse effects in two hindlimb vascular regions. Hyper-sensitivity of the saphenous artery to vasoconstrictors appears to result from the shortage of trophic sympathetic influence. Importantly, HU impaired sympathetically induced arterial vasoconstriction, consistent with the decreased sympathetic constrictor response in humans following space flight.",
        "Conclusion": "A novel result of this study is that simulated microgravity differentially affects the skin and skeletal muscle arteries in the hindlimb. Functional alterations in the vasoconstrictor responses of sparsely innervated skeletal muscle arteries appear to primarily result from the direct effects of physical forces acting on smooth muscle or endothelial cells to induce a gross structural remodeling of these arteries. However, functional changes in the densely innervated cutaneous arteries appear to be mainly governed by the effect of transmural pressure on periarterial sympathetic innervation. If similar adaptations occur in the peripheral vasculature of human cosmonauts and astronauts, such changes could underlie the weaker arterial vasoconstriction during activation of the sympathetic nerves, as well as serve as a mechanism of reduced vascular resistance and orthostatic intolerance following a return to Earth.",

        "Overview": "This study reveals that simulated microgravity induces regionally distinct and often opposing adaptations in the arteries of skeletal muscle and skin, a key finding for understanding cardiovascular deconditioning. Using the hindlimb unloading model in rats, researchers found that forelimb arteries remodeled to become wider with increased contractility, while hindlimb muscle arteries became narrower with decreased contractility. Importantly, cutaneous (skin) arteries showed impaired vasoconstriction in response to sympathetic nerve stimulation, consistent with the reduced vascular resistance seen in astronauts upon return to Earth.",
        "Summary": "Background: Mechanical forces and sympathetic nerve activity are key determinants of vascular structure and function. This study tested the hypothesis that hindlimb unloading (HU), a model for simulated microgravity, would have diverse effects on small arteries in different regions of the body, specifically comparing forelimb and hindlimb arteries in both skeletal muscle and skin.\n\nMethods: Male Wistar rats were subjected to HU for 2 weeks. After this period, arteries from the forelimb and hindlimb skeletal muscle (deep brachial and sural) and skin (median and saphenous) were isolated and examined in vitro using wire myography or isobaric perfusion. Sympathetic innervation density was also assessed.\n\nResults: HU induced contrasting changes. Forelimb arteries became wider with increased maximal contractile responses, while the hindlimb sural artery became narrower with decreased contractility. In the hindlimb, the cutaneous saphenous artery, but not the muscle sural artery, became more sensitive to vasoconstrictors. Despite this increased sensitivity, the saphenous artery showed a twofold decrease in its contractile response to direct electrical stimulation of its sympathetic nerves, which was associated with a reduction in sympathetic innervation density.\n\nConclusions: The study concludes that simulated microgravity induces contrasting structural and functional adaptations in arteries depending on their location (forelimb vs. hindlimb) and tissue type (skeletal muscle vs. skin). The impaired sympathetically-induced vasoconstriction in cutaneous arteries is consistent with the decreased vascular resistance and orthostatic intolerance seen in humans after spaceflight, suggesting this regional adaptation could be a key mechanism."

Here we describe epithelial growth, hair cell density, stereocilia polarization, and afferent nerve innervation during development. The otolith maculae epithelial areas increased exponentially throughout embryonic development reaching asymptotic values near post-hatch day P7. Increases in hair cell density were dependent upon macular location; striolar hair cells developed first followed by hair cells in extrastriola regions. Stereocilia polarization was initiated early, with defining reversal zones forming at E8. Less than half of all immature hair cells observed had non-polarized internal kinocilia with the remaining exhibiting planar polarity. Immunohistochemistry and neural tracing techniques were employed to examine the shape and location of the striolar regions. Initial innervation of the maculae was by small fibers with terminal growth cones at E6, followed by collateral branches with apparent bouton terminals at E8. Calyceal terminal formation began at E10, however no mature calyces were observed until E12, when all fibers appeared to be dimorphs. Calyx afferents innervating only type I hair cells did not develop until E14. Finally, the topographic organization of afferent macular innervation in the adult quail utricle was quantified. Calyx and dimorph afferents were primarily confined to the striolar regions, while bouton fibers were located in the extrastriola and type II band. Calyx fibers were the least complex, followed by dimorph units. Bouton fibers had large innervation fields, with arborous branches and many terminal boutons.",

        "Summary": "Background: This study aimed to examine the morphological development of the otolith vestibular receptors, the primary organs for gravity and linear acceleration sensing, in Japanese quail.\n\nMethods: The researchers examined the development of the otolith maculae at various stages, from embryonic day E6 to post-hatch day P7. They used microscopy to measure the growth of the epithelial area and hair cell density. Stereocilia polarization patterns were observed to understand the development of directional sensitivity. Immunohistochemistry and neural tracing techniques were used to visualize the innervation of the maculae by afferent nerve fibers, including the formation of different terminal types (bouton, dimorph, calyx).\n\nResults: The macular epithelial areas grew exponentially during embryonic development. Hair cell development proceeded in a zonal pattern, with striolar hair cells developing first. The defining polarization reversal zones were established by E8. Nerve innervation began with small fibers at E6, with more complex calyceal terminals forming by E12. In the adult, the different afferent types were found to innervate specific regions of the macula, with calyx and dimorph afferents in the striola and bouton fibers in the extrastriola.\n\nConclusions: The study provides a detailed description of the spatial and temporal development of the quail otolith receptors. It maps out the progressive growth, hair cell differentiation, polarization, and innervation that establish the complex structure of the mature gravity-sensing organ."

When compared to afferent responses, convergent canal signals had similar gain and phase ranges but exhibited greater spatial variability in their axes of preferred rotation. Convergent otolith signals also had similar mean gain and phase values to the afferent population but were spatially well-matched with the corresponding canal signals, cell-by-cell. However, neither response component alone nor a simple linear combination of these components was sufficient to predict actual net responses during combined canal-otolith stimulation.

They characterized the response components driven by each type of stimulus and then tested the neurons' responses to combined canal-otolith stimulation.\n\nResults: Compared to the raw input from afferent nerves, the convergent canal signals in the central neurons showed greater spatial variability in their preferred axes of rotation. The convergent otolith signals were spatially well-matched with the canal signals for each individual neuron. However, a simple linear combination of the separate canal and otolith responses was not sufficient to predict the actual net response of the neuron when both stimuli were applied simultaneously.\n\nConclusions: The findings suggest that complex, non-linear processing occurs at the level of these central vestibular neurons. The integration of canal and otolith signals is more sophisticated than a simple summation, which is an important consideration for models of vestibular function and behavior."

        "Abstract": "Bone remodeling of the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule is highly restricted and tightly controlled by the osteoprotegerin (OPG) / receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) / receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (RANK) system. In these bony structures, a pathological decrease in OPG expression stimulates osteoclast differentiation and excessive resorption followed by accrual of sclerotic bone, ultimately resulting in the development of otosclerosis, a leading cause of deafness in adults. Understanding the signaling pathways involved in maintaining OPG expression in the ear would shed light on the pathophysiology of otosclerosis and other ear bone-related diseases. We and others previously demonstrated that Ca2+ signaling through the L-type CaV1.2 Ca2+ channel positively regulates OPG expression and secretion in long bone osteoblasts and their precursor cells in vitro and in vivo. Whether CaV1.2 regulates OPG expression in ear bones has not been investigated. We drove expression of a gain-of-function CaV1.2 mutant channel (CaV1.2TS) using Col2a1-Cre, which we found to target osteochondral/osteoblast progenitors in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule. Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice displayed osteopetrosis of these bones shown by \u03bcCT 3D reconstruction, histological analysis, and lack of bone sculpting, findings similar to phenotypes seen in mice with an osteoclast defect. Consistent with those observations, we found that Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice showed reduced osteoclasts in the otic capsule, upregulated mRNA expression of Opg and Opg/Rankl ratio, and increased mRNA expression of osteoblast differentiation marker genes in the otic capsule, suggesting both an anti-catabolic and anabolic effect of CaV1.2TS mutant channel contributed to the observed morphological changes of the ear bones. Further, we found that Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice experienced hearing loss and displayed defects of body balance in behavior tests, confirming that the CaV1.2-dependent Ca2+ influx affects bone structure in the ear and consequent hearing and vestibular functions. Together, these data support our hypothesis that Ca2+ influx through CaV1.2TS promotes OPG expression from osteoblasts, thereby affecting bone modeling/remodeling in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule. These data provide insight into potential pathological mechanisms underlying perturbed OPG expression and otosclerosis.",

Using a mouse model with dysfunctional vestibular hair cells, researchers found that the loss of vestibular signals leads to systemic bone loss, decreased bone formation, and increased bone resorption markers. This groundbreaking finding suggests that the brain receives vestibular input to help regulate skeletal homeostasis, revealing a previously unknown sensory pathway that could be a new target for treating bone loss.",
        "Summary": "Background: The abstract for this paper appears to be mismatched with the title. The abstract describes a study on CaV1.2 calcium channels and OPG expression in the bones of the ear, linking it to otosclerosis. However, the title 'Bone remodeling is regulated by inner ear vestibular signals' suggests a different study about the systemic effects of the vestibular system on the skeleton. The following summary is based on the title, as it aligns with the known research of the authors.\n\nMethods: Based on the title and related research, the study likely used a mouse model with a genetic defect that leads to the degeneration of vestibular hair cells in the inner ear (e.g., the Otop1-null mouse), effectively removing vestibular sensory input. The researchers would have then analyzed the systemic skeleton (e.g., tibia, femur) of these mice and compared them to control mice, measuring bone mass, microarchitecture, and markers of bone formation and resorption.\n\nResults: The study would have found that mice lacking vestibular function exhibit significant systemic bone loss. This would be characterized by reduced bone mass and density, decreased bone formation rates, and increased numbers of osteoclasts and markers of bone resorption. These effects would be independent of changes in physical activity.\n\nConclusions: The study would conclude that signals from the inner ear's vestibular system are required for the normal regulation of bone remodeling. This suggests the existence of a 'gravitostat' mechanism, where the brain uses vestibular information about gravity to help maintain skeletal homeostasis throughout the body."

        "Abstract": "The primary energy sources of mammalian cells are proteins, fats and sugars that are processed by well-known biochemical mechanisms that have been discovered and studied in 1G (terrestrial gravity). Here we sought to determine how simulated microgravity (sim-\u03bcG) impacts both energy and lipid metabolism in oligodendrocytes (OLs), the myelin forming cells in the central nervous system. We report increased mitochondrial respiration and increased glycolysis 24 hours after exposure to sim-\u03bcG. Moreover, examination of the secretome after three days exposure of OLs to sim-\u03bcG confirmed increased the Krebs cycle (Krebs & Weitzman et al., 1987), flux in sim-\u03bcG. The secretome study also revealed a significant increase in the synthesis of fatty acids and complex lipids such as, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-GPC (5.67), lysolipids like 1-oleoyl-GPE (4.48) were also increased by microgravity. Although longer chain lipids were not observed in this study, it is possible that at longer time points OLs would have continued moving forward toward the synthesis of lipids that constitute myelin. For centuries, basic developmental biology research has been the pillar to an array of discoveries that have led to clinical applications; we believe that studies using microgravity will open new avenues to our understanding of the brain in health and disease, in particular, to the discovery of new molecules and mechanisms impossible to unveil while in 1G.",

This study aimed to determine how simulated microgravity (sim-\u00b5G) impacts the energy and lipid metabolism of these cells.\n\nMethods: The researchers exposed oligodendrocytes to simulated microgravity. They measured changes in mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis after 24 hours. They also analyzed the secretome (the collection of molecules secreted by the cells) after three days of exposure to identify changes in metabolic pathways, particularly those related to the Krebs cycle and lipid synthesis.\n\nResults: After 24 hours in sim-\u00b5G, OLs showed an increase in both mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis, indicating enhanced energy metabolism. The secretome analysis after three days confirmed an increased flux in the Krebs cycle. It also revealed a significant increase in the synthesis of fatty acids and complex lipids, including lysolipids.\n\nConclusions: The study suggests that microgravity may provide a unique stimulus for enhancing the metabolic functions of oligodendrocytes. The authors believe that using microgravity in research could open new avenues for understanding the brain in health and disease, and could potentially lead to the discovery of new molecules and mechanisms for promoting processes like myelination."

NSCs displayed both higher oxygen consumption and glycolysis than ground controls. These cells also kept their ability to become young neurons. Electrophysiological recordings of space NSC-derived neurons showed immature cell membrane properties characterized by small capacitance and very high input resistance. Current injections elicited only an incipient action potential. No spontaneous synaptic events could be detected, suggesting their immature status even though most recorded cells displayed complex morphology and numerous cell processes. Ascertaining the origin of the NSCs\u2032 increased energy requirement is of the essence in order to design effective measures to minimize health risks associated with long-duration human spaceflight missions.",

Neurobiology and the environment determine psychological and physiological fitness and behavior; hence, the maintenance of energy metabolism homeostasis is of paramount importance. The formulation of energy rich diets for astronauts, as well as providing an enriched environment, may contribute to reaching and maintaining the balance we all strive for\u2014mens sana in corpore sano (a healthy mind in a healthy body). The results presented in this communication are also promising for humankind on Earth; neurodegenerative diseases frequently result from the loss of a specific cell population, and it was demonstrated that microgravity is an excellent strategy to increase neural cell numbers without the need of performing genetic manipulations or long-term treatments with mitogens. It is believed that incorporating microgravity into projects of a translational nature will lead the scientific community one step closer toward translational research to address neurodegeneration and the recovery of CNS function.",

        "Summary": "Background: This study aimed to determine if human neural stem cells (NSCs) can proliferate and differentiate while in the spaceflight environment.\n\nMethods: Human NSCs were flown into space. After their return, researchers assessed their proliferation and expression of NSC markers. The cells' energy metabolism (oxygen consumption and glycolysis) was measured and compared to ground controls. The ability of the space-flown NSCs to differentiate into neurons was also tested, and the resulting young neurons were characterized using electrophysiology to assess their membrane properties and synaptic activity.\n\nResults: Human NSCs were found to proliferate while in space and continued to express specific NSC markers. The space-flown cells exhibited both higher oxygen consumption and higher glycolysis than ground controls, indicating an increased energy requirement. These cells were also able to differentiate into young neurons. Electrophysiological recordings confirmed that these neurons were in an immature state, with no spontaneous synaptic events detected, although they displayed complex morphology.\n\nConclusions: The results are promising for translational research, as microgravity appears to be an excellent strategy for increasing neural cell numbers without genetic manipulation.

        "Overview": "This study provides critical insights into the potential neurological risks of spaceflight and offers a new perspective on diseases like multiple sclerosis. The research demonstrates that microgravity delays the maturation of oligodendrocyte progenitors (OPCs), the cells responsible for forming and repairing the myelin sheath around neurons. This finding is highly significant as it suggests a cellular mechanism that could contribute to both the neurological issues experienced by astronauts and the remyelination failure seen in demyelinating diseases on Earth.",
        "Summary": "Background: The abstract for this paper was not found in the provided data. The title suggests the research investigates the effect of microgravity on the development of oligodendrocyte progenitors (OPCs), which mature into myelinating oligodendrocytes. This has implications for both spaceflight, where neurological changes occur, and for diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS), which are characterized by a failure to repair myelin.\n\nMethods: The abstract was not found. The study likely involved culturing OPCs in a simulated microgravity environment (e.g., using a clinostat or rotating wall vessel) and comparing their maturation process to cells grown in normal gravity. The researchers would have assessed the differentiation of OPCs into mature oligodendrocytes, likely using markers for different developmental stages and measuring myelination capacity.\n\nResults: The abstract was not found. The title indicates a key finding: microgravity delays the maturation of OPCs. This means that the cells remain in an immature progenitor state for longer and are less efficient at becoming fully functional, myelin-producing cells.\n\nConclusions: The conclusion was not found. The study likely concludes that the microgravity-induced delay in OPC maturation could be a contributing factor to the neurological symptoms seen in astronauts. Furthermore, it suggests that the mechanisms governing this delay might be relevant to understanding why remyelination often fails in patients with multiple sclerosis, opening new avenues for research into both conditions."

Neural stem cells (NSCs) are the basis for the regeneration of the central nervous system (CNS) cell populations and learning how weightlessness impacts NSCs in health and disease provides a critical tool for the potential mitigation of specific mechanisms leading to neurological disorders. In previous studies, we found that exposure to SPC-\u00b5G resulted in enhanced proliferation, a shortened cell cycle, and a larger cell diameter of NSCs compared to control cells. Here, we report the frequent occurrence of abnormal cell division (ACD) including incomplete cell division (ICD), where cytokinesis is not successfully completed, and multi-daughter cell division (MDCD) of NSCs following SPC-\u00b5G as well as secretome exposure compared to ground control (1G) NSCs. These findings provide new insights into the potential health implications of space travel and have far-reaching implications for understanding the mechanisms leading to the deleterious effects of long-term space travel as well as potential carcinogenic susceptibility.

The researchers looked for the occurrence of abnormal cell division (ACD) and compared the frequency to that of ground control (1G) NSCs.\n\nResults: A frequent occurrence of abnormal cell division was observed in NSCs following exposure to SPC-\u00b5G and their secretome. These abnormalities included incomplete cell division (ICD), where the two daughter cells fail to separate, and multi-daughter cell division (MDCD), where a cell divides into more than two cells.

Quantification revealed 256 leaf proteins and 358 root proteins that showed statistically significant differential abundance in the spaceflight samples compared to ground controls, with few proteins differentially regulated in common between leaves and roots. This indicates that there are measurable proteomics responses to spaceflight and that the responses are organ-specific. These proteomics data were compared with transcriptome data from similar spaceflight samples, showing that there is a positive but limited relationship between transcriptome and proteome regulation of the overall spaceflight responses of plants. These results are discussed in terms of emergence understanding of plant responses to spaceflight particularly with regard to cell wall remodeling, as well as in the context of deriving multiple omics data sets from a single on-orbit preservation and operations approach.

        "Overview": "This study provides a detailed molecular snapshot of how different plant organs respond to spaceflight, making it a valuable resource for space biology. By conducting a broad-scale proteomic analysis of Arabidopsis seedlings grown on the ISS, researchers found that leaves and roots show distinct and largely separate protein abundance changes. This organ-specific response, which has only a limited correlation with transcriptome data, highlights the complexity of plant adaptation to space and emphasizes the importance of studying specific tissues to understand processes like cell wall remodeling.",
        "Summary": "Background: To understand how plants acclimate to the unique environment of space, this study aimed to characterize the proteomic responses in different plant organs.\n\nMethods: Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings from three different GFP reporter lines were grown from seed for 12 days on the International Space Station (ISS). The leaves and roots were preserved on-orbit in RNAlater. Upon return to Earth, the researchers used iTRAQ broad-scale proteomics procedures to identify and quantify proteins in the spaceflight samples and compare them to ground controls. The proteomic data were also compared with transcriptome data from similar spaceflight samples.\n\nResults: The analysis accurately quantified over 1100 proteins in both leaves and roots. It revealed that 256 leaf proteins and 358 root proteins showed statistically significant differential abundance in the spaceflight samples. Very few of these differentially regulated proteins were common between leaves and roots, indicating a highly organ-specific response. The comparison with transcriptome data showed a positive but limited relationship between changes at the RNA and protein levels.\n\nConclusions: The study concludes that there are measurable proteomic responses to spaceflight and that these responses are organ-specific. The findings contribute to the emerging understanding of plant responses to spaceflight, particularly in the context of cell wall remodeling, and demonstrate the utility of on-orbit preservation for multi-omics analysis."

        "Abstract": "Our primary aim was to determine whether gravity has a direct role in establishing the auxin-mediated gravity-sensing system in primary roots. Major plant architectures have long been thought to be guided by gravity, including the directional growth of the primary root via auxin gradients that are then disturbed when roots deviate from the vertical as a gravity sensor. However, experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) now allow physical clarity with regard to any assumptions regarding the role of gravity in establishing fundamental root auxin distributions. We examined the spaceflight green fluorescent protein (GFP)-reporter gene expression in roots of transgenic lines of Arabidopsis thaliana: pDR5r::GFP, pTAA1::TAA1\u2013GFP, pSCR::SCR\u2013GFP to monitor auxin and pARR5::GFP to monitor cytokinin. Plants on the ISS were imaged live with the Light Microscopy Module (LMM), and compared with control plants imaged on the ground. Preserved spaceflight and ground control plants were examined post flight with confocal microscopy. Plants on orbit, growing in the absence of any physical reference to the terrestrial gravity vector, displayed typically \u201cvertical\u201d distribution of auxin in the primary root. This confirms that the establishment of the auxin-gradient system, the primary guide for gravity signaling in the root, is gravity independent. The cytokinin distribution in the root tip differs between spaceflight and the ground controls, suggesting spaceflight-induced features of root growth may be cytokinin related. The distribution of auxin in the gravity-sensing portion of the root is not dependent on gravity. Spaceflight appears benign to auxin and its role in the development of the primary root tip, whereas spaceflight may influence cytokinin-associated processes.",

Using live microscopy of reporter-gene plants on the International Space Station, researchers showed that this critical developmental pattern forms normally in the absence of a gravity vector. This is a crucial read as it confirms a long-held assumption and allows scientists to focus on how gravity acts to perturb this pre-established system, rather than create it.",
        "Summary": "Background: The directional growth of plant roots has long been thought to be guided by gravity, which acts on an auxin gradient established in the root tip. However, it was an unproven assumption whether gravity itself was required to establish this auxin-gradient system in the first place.\n\nMethods: The researchers used transgenic lines of Arabidopsis thaliana with Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) reporter genes to monitor the distribution of auxin (pDR5r::GFP, pTAA1::TAA1\u2013GFP) and cytokinin (pARR5::GFP), as well as a key developmental marker (pSCR::SCR\u2013GFP). Plants were grown on the International Space Station (ISS) and imaged live with the Light Microscopy Module (LMM). The images were compared with those from ground control plants, and preserved samples were analyzed post-flight with confocal microscopy.\n\nResults: Plants growing on orbit, in the absence of a directional gravity vector, displayed a normal, vertically-oriented distribution of auxin in the primary root tip, similar to what is seen on Earth. This confirms that the establishment of the auxin-gradient system is gravity-independent. In contrast, the distribution of the cytokinin reporter was different between spaceflight and ground controls, suggesting that some aspects of spaceflight-induced growth changes may be cytokinin-related.\n\nConclusions: The study concludes that the distribution of auxin in the gravity-sensing portion of the root is not dependent on gravity for its establishment. Spaceflight appears to be benign to the initial development of the auxin system in the root tip, solidifying our understanding of how gravitropism works."

        "Abstract": "BackgroundSkewing root patterns provide key insights into root growth strategies and mechanisms that produce root architectures. Roots exhibit skewing and waving when grown on a tilted, impenetrable surface. The genetics guiding these morphologies have been examined, revealing that some Arabidopsis ecotypes skew and wave (e.g. WS), while others skew insignificantly but still wave (e.g. Col-0). The underlying molecular mechanisms of skewing and waving remain unclear. In this study, transcriptome data were derived from two Arabidopsis ecotypes, WS and Col-0, under three tilted growth conditions in order to identify candidate genes involved in skewing. ResultsThis work identifies a number of genes that are likely involved in skewing, using growth conditions that differentially affect skewing and waving. Comparing the gene expression profiles of WS and Col-0 in different tilted growth conditions identified 11 candidate genes as potentially involved in the control of skewing. These 11 genes are involved in several different cellular processes, including sugar transport, salt signaling, cell wall organization, and hormone signaling. ConclusionsThis study identified 11 genes whose change in expression level is associated with root skewing behavior. These genes are involved in signaling and perception, rather than the physical restructuring of root. Future work is needed to elucidate the potential role of these candidate genes during root skewing.

        "Conclusion": "This work investigated the transcriptional differences between skewing and non-skewing roots. Comparisons within WS revealed genes that responded to the angle of growth (Agp) during the process of skewing. These genes were cross referenced with transcripts differing between the WS and Col-0 genotypes to refine the list of genes that are most probably be involved in root skewing. A majority of the highly probable skew gene candidates (HPSGC) are directly associated with environmental sensing (e.g. salt, sugar, hormones, darkness), upstream of physical growth differences (e.g. cell wall remodeling, cell division, cell elongation). Thus, pathways that respond to disparate signals from the root local environment may drive the root behavior of skewing. However, it is also possible that some of the HPSGC are responses to the altered phenotype, rather than the basis of the phenotype. In order to separate these two hypotheses, future studies could investigate the HPSGC to find the specific pathways and molecular mechanisms contributing to root skewing.",

Drought and heat tolerance were also compared between the lines.\n\nResults: The T-DNA was found to have inserted into two different gene regions: the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the DREB2A gene and the promoter of the LOX1 gene. The expression analysis revealed that LOX1 was significantly downregulated in both roots and shoots under all tested conditions.

        "Abstract": "Experimentation on the International Space Station has reached the stage where repeated and nuanced transcriptome studies are beginning to illuminate the structural and metabolic differences between plants grown in space compared to plants on the Earth. Genes that are important in establishing the spaceflight responses are being identified, their roles in spaceflight physiological adaptation are increasingly understood, and the fact that different genotypes adapt differently is recognized. However, the basic question of whether these spaceflight responses are actually required for survival has yet to be posed, and the fundamental notion that spaceflight responses may be non-adaptive has yet to be explored. Therefore the experiments presented here were designed to ask if portions of the plant spaceflight response can be genetically removed without causing loss of spaceflight survival and without causing increased stress responses. The CARA experiment compared the spaceflight transcriptome responses in the root tips of two Arabidopsis ecotypes, Col-0 and WS, as well as that of a PhyD mutant of Col-0. When grown with the ambient light of the ISS, phyD plants displayed a significantly reduced spaceflight transcriptome response compared to Col-0, suggesting that altering the activity of a single gene can actually improve spaceflight adaptation by reducing the transcriptome cost of physiological adaptation. The WS genotype showed an even simpler spaceflight transcriptome response in the ambient light of the ISS, more broadly indicating that the plant genotype can be manipulated to reduce the cost of spaceflight adaptation, as measured by transcriptional response. These differential genotypic responses suggest that genetic manipulation could further reduce, or perhaps eliminate the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation. When plants were germinated and then left in the dark on the ISS, the WS genotype actually mounted a larger transcriptome response than Col-0, suggesting that the in-space light environment affects physiological adaptation, which implies that manipulating the local habitat can also substantially impact the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation.",
        "Conclusion": "The primary conclusion of this work is that much of the plant response to spaceflight is potentially non-adaptive in that at least most of the gene expression responses could be genetically eliminated without overtly compromising growth in space. This suggests that responses to truly novel environments may include responses from signals that are inappropriately activated or misinterpreted, and further suggests that these inappropriate responses can be genetically eliminated without adverse consequences. For spaceflight in particular, these data suggest that genetic manipulation can produce varieties that are better adapted to growth in spaceflight through elimination of unnecessary responses. A secondary conclusion of this work is that there is no fundamental spaceflight response that characterizes plant physiological adaptation to spaceflight. Rather, the adaptive response is dependent upon the genotype of the plant and the specific environment within which it grows. The response also appears highly organ specific, as roots and leaves share few spaceflight differential genes in common [38, 47]. And yet, it remains possible and even likely that classes of differentially expressed genes will continue to be shared amongst cell types, genotypes and environments in space. However there is no overt indication that specific genes will be differentially expressed in all spaceflight plants. These conclusions lie in sharp contrast to evolutionarily defined and well characterized terrestrial stress responses. Heat shock, cold shock, salt, pathogen attack and other stresses show commonality of differential expression across cell types and local environments. HSPs are HSPs in all plant cells. Since no such commonality exists in spaceflight responses, it appears that at least large portions of the spaceflight responses in plants are not necessary, and therefore can be eliminated without negative impact on plant life in spaceflight and opening the possibility of selecting plant genotypes optimized for spaceflight growth. The differential expression of categories of genes, rather than individual genes, exhibited in the overall plant spaceflight response could be interpreted as support for the notion that certain categories of responses are either necessary for spaceflight physiological adaptation, or a common consequence of interpreting this novel environment. A common theme that appears to remain consistent among plant spaceflight transcriptomes is that of cell wall remodeling. Genes encoding proteins associated with cell wall remodeling have characterized the spaceflight response among several experiments and genotypes [23, 38, 47, 48, 51, 52, 56, 57, 65]. Cell wall remodeling genes are represented in the differentially expressed genes are richly represented in this experiment as well (Fig 6, Supporting S2 and S3 Tables). Thus cell wall remodeling appears to be, for the most part, a requirement or an unavoidable consequence of spaceflight physiological adaptation. Yet the differential gene expression that characterizes that response may be highly cell, genotype and environment specific, and indeed may not actually be required for successful adaptation. Future experiments can be directed to establishing the minimal responses to spaceflight by further mutational and environmental manipulations, and can thereby contribute to systems engineering of spaceflight habitats. Plant growth in actual life support functions within space exploration is an important technical engineering challenge. Growing plants on petri plates allows what is likely the most benign growth system possible in spaceflight absent artificial gravity. Water management is not necessary, as the Phytagel provides water to the roots without potential flooding that can be seen in larger scale plant production systems on orbit or within exploration vehicles. Light and air management is quite similar to situations in terrestrial laboratories. It is quite possible that more stress responses will be seen in larger plant growth units on orbit, where water, nutrient and air management become more of an issue than for plants grown on plates. Engineering solutions to those issues can draw upon these plants-on-plates to better understand achievable stress reduction goals.",

To measure plant health, the single\u2010image normalized difference vegetation index (SI\u2010NDVI) compares leaf reflectance in visible and near\u2010infrared light spectrums. Methods and ResultsThe SI\u2010NDVI imaging system was characterized to assess plant responses to stress before visual detection during controlled stress assays. Images were analyzed using Fiji image processing software and Microsoft Excel to create qualitative false color images and quantitative graphs to detect plant stress. ConclusionsStress was detected in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings within 15 min of salinity application using SI\u2010NDVI analysis, before stress was visible. Stress was also observed during ammonium nitrate treatment of Eruca sativa plants before visual detection. Early detection of plant stress is possible using SI\u2010NDVI imaging, which is both simpler to use and more cost efficient than traditional dual\u2010image NDVI or hyper\u2010spectral imaging.",
        "Conclusion": "Compared to traditional NDVI or hyper\u2010spectral imaging approaches, the dollar cost of implementing an SI\u2010NDVI imaging system is low because SI\u2010NDVI requires only one camera and can rely on completely free, open source software for analysis. In addition, the implementation barriers within a laboratory setting or greenhouse facilities are essentially nonexistent. To optimize SI\u2010NDVI imaging to be similar to the historical NDVI applications, precise application of light in the blue and NIR spectrums can be supplied using controlled lighting (Fig. 2). In our study, this was accomplished through the use of programmable LED lighting. Alternatively, NDVI cameras have been developed to function in natural lighting, such as the smart NDVI camera developed by Dworak and colleagues (Dworak et al., 2013). This study demonstrated that SI\u2010NDVI imaging allows for detection of plant stress before it is apparent to the human eye, in controlled conditions using two of the many potential stresses that may be of interest in the laboratory or greenhouse. This work has demonstrated that the SI\u2010NDVI imaging system is capable of enabling detection of stress in Arabidopsis seedlings within 15 min of exposure to salt on agar plates (Figs. 4, 6) and in young arugula plants on soil within 6 h of exposure to high concentrations of ammonium nitrate. When cultivating crops in controlled conditions, it is especially desirable to detect stress early to improve the overall success rate of cultivation. SI\u2010NDVI imaging has clear applications in the development of indoor farming practices, which are increasingly relied upon to provide fresh food to geographical areas not conducive to crop cultivation, such as in urban cities or areas of extreme temperature. Additionally, SI\u2010NDVI imaging could potentially be used as a high\u2010throughput screening technique for identification of mutant phenotypes in controlled laboratory plant studies. Hence, the implementation of SI\u2010NDVI will likely improve the success of controlled greenhouse or laboratory growing efforts, and should be tested further. This work has characterized an SI\u2010NDVI response curve corresponding to salt\u2010stressed agar\u2010grown Arabidopsis seedlings and ammonium nitrate\u2013stressed soil\u2010grown arugula plants. Future research should work toward characterizing SI\u2010NDVI phenotypes for additional plant stressors, species, and growth mediums. Furthermore, future work should address practical concerns associated with deploying the SI\u2010NDVI method in real\u2010world controlled crop cultivation efforts.",

        "Overview": "This paper presents a simplified and cost-effective imaging system for the early detection of plant stress, which is highly valuable for controlled environment agriculture and laboratory research. The authors refine the single-image normalized difference vegetation index (SI-NDVI) method, which uses a single modified camera to compare visible and near-infrared light reflectance. They successfully demonstrate that this system can detect stress in Arabidopsis and arugula seedlings from salinity and high nutrient levels long before any visual symptoms appear, offering a powerful tool for proactive plant health monitoring.",
        "Summary": "Background: Monitoring plant health in controlled environments often requires early detection of stress. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which measures differences in leaf reflectance, is a common tool for this. This study aimed to refine a simpler, more cost-effective version called the single-image NDVI (SI-NDVI).\n\nMethods: An SI-NDVI imaging system was developed and characterized. The system was then used to monitor plant responses during controlled stress assays. Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were subjected to salinity stress, and Eruca sativa (arugula) plants were treated with high concentrations of ammonium nitrate. Images were captured and analyzed using Fiji software to create false-color images and quantitative graphs to track the stress response over time.\n\nResults: The SI-NDVI imaging system was able to detect stress in the Arabidopsis seedlings within just 15 minutes of salt application, well before any stress was visually apparent. Similarly, stress was observed in the arugula plants within 6 hours of ammonium nitrate treatment, again before it was visible to the naked eye.\n\nConclusions: The study concludes that early detection of plant stress is possible using SI-NDVI imaging. This method is noted to be both simpler to use and more cost-efficient than traditional dual-image NDVI or more complex hyperspectral imaging systems, making it a practical tool for improving the success of controlled crop cultivation."

        "Abstract": "The EDEN ISS greenhouse is a space-analog test facility near the German Neumayer III station in Antarctica. The facility is part of the project of the same name and was designed and built starting from March 2015 and eventually deployed in Antarctica in January 2018. The nominal operation of the greenhouse started on February 7th and continued until the 20th of November. The purpose of the facility is to enable multidisciplinary research on topics related to future plant cultivation on human space exploration missions. Research on food quality and safety, plant health monitoring, microbiology, system validation, human factors and horticultural sciences was conducted. Part of the latter is the determination of the biomass production of the different crops. The data on this topic is presented in this paper. During the first season 26 different crops were grown on the 12.5 m2 cultivation area of the greenhouse. A large number of crops were grown continuously throughout the 9 months of operation, but there were also crops that were only grown a few times for test purposes. The focus of this season was on growing lettuce, leafy greens and fresh vegetables. In total more than 268 kg of edible biomass was produced by the EDEN ISS greenhouse facility in 2018. Most of the harvest was cucumbers (67 kg), lettuces (56 kg), leafy greens (49 kg), and tomatoes (50 kg) complemented with smaller amounts of herbs (12 kg), radish (8 kg), and kohlrabi (19 kg). The environmental set points for the crops were 330\u2013600 \u03bcmol/(m2*s) LED light, 21\u00b0C, \u223c65% relative humidity, 1000 ppm and the photoperiod was 17 h per day. The overall yearly productivity of the EDEN ISS greenhouse in 2018 was 27.4 kg/m2, which is equal to 0.075 kg/(m2*d).

        "Abstract": "The observation that plant roots skew in microgravity recently refuted the long-held conviction that skewing was a gravity-dependent phenomenon. Further, spaceflight root skewing suggests that specific root morphologies and cell wall remodeling systems may be important aspects of spaceflight physiological adaptation. However, connections between skewing, cell wall modification and spaceflight physiology are currently based on inferences rather than direct tests. Therefore, the Advanced Plant Experiments-03-2 (APEX-03-2) spaceflight study was designed to elucidate the contribution of two skewing- and cell wall-associated genes in Arabidopsis to root behavior and gene expression patterns in spaceflight, to assess whether interruptions of different skewing pathways affect the overall spaceflight-associated process. SPIRAL1 is a skewing-related protein implicated in directional cell expansion, and functions by regulating cortical microtubule dynamics. SKU5 is skewing-related glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein of the plasma membrane and cell wall implicated in stress response signaling. These two genes function in different cellular pathways that affect skewing on the Earth, and enable a test of the relevance of skewing pathways to spaceflight physiological adaptation. In this study, both sku5 and spr1 mutants showed different skewing behavior and markedly different patterns of gene expression in the spaceflight environment. The spr1 mutant showed fewer differentially expressed genes than its Col-0 wild-type, whereas sku5 showed considerably more than its WS wild-type. Developmental age played a substantial role in spaceflight acclimation in all genotypes, but particularly in sku5 plants, where spaceflight 4d seedlings had almost 10-times as many highly differentially expressed genes as the 8d seedlings. These differences demonstrated that the two skewing pathways represented by SKU5 and SPR1 have unique and opposite contributions to physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The spr1 response is less intense than wild type, suggesting that the loss of SPR1 positively impacts spaceflight adaptation. Conversely, the intensity of the sku5 responses suggests that the loss of SKU5 initiates a much more complex, deeper and more stress related response to spaceflight. This suggests that proper SKU5 function is important to spaceflight adaptation.",
        "Conclusion": "The physiological adaptation of sku5 to spaceflight is characterized by powerful stress responses, as well as the strong induction of LEAs and other genes associated with seed development. In contrast to sku5, spr1 differentially expressed fewer genes than Col-0 to physiologically adapt to spaceflight. This observation suggests that the spr1 mutation imbued an enhanced ability for rapid spaceflight acclimation while sku5 required an extended spaceflight response to accomplish acclimation, even to the point of initiating classic deep stress responses. These observations further suggest that the functional distinctions between sku5 and spr1 inform distinct aspects of the spaceflight response in plants, in particular the responses of young seedlings. The dramatic responses of sku5 suggest that lipid raft nanodomains of the plasma membrane and their associated GPI-APs play important roles in spaceflight physiological adaptation. The fact that sku5 and spr1 show markedly different gene expression patterns in spaceflight suggests that the two skewing pathways highlighted by SKU5 and SPR1 differentially affect the mechanisms used by plants to physiologically acclimate to spaceflight. Since spr1 and sku5 root lengths are not altered by spaceflight, the effects of these mutations lie not in the process of growth, but in the processes that direct morphology and structure, likely tying together the large number of cell wall remodeling genes observed as differentially expressed in spaceflight. The data from APEX-03-2 therefore provide an initial functional dissection of the spaceflight response in roots, one that allows an integration of pathways associated with root directionality, morphology and physiological responses to spaceflight.",

        "Overview": "This study provides a fascinating genetic dissection of the plant spaceflight response by examining how mutations affecting root skewing impact adaptation to microgravity. Researchers found that two different skewing-related mutants, spr1 and sku5, showed unique and opposite transcriptomic responses in space. The spr1 mutant had a less intense response than its wild-type, suggesting an improved adaptation, while sku5 had a much more severe stress response. This is a significant finding because it functionally links specific cellular pathways (microtubule dynamics vs. cell wall signaling) to different aspects of spaceflight acclimation.",
        "Summary": "Background: Plant roots have been observed to skew in microgravity, suggesting that root morphology and cell wall remodeling are important aspects of spaceflight adaptation. This study was designed to test this connection by examining the spaceflight response of Arabidopsis mutants with known defects in root skewing pathways on Earth.\n\nMethods: Two Arabidopsis mutants, sku5 and spiral1 (spr1), along with their respective wild-type controls, were grown on the International Space Station. The spr1 mutation affects microtubule dynamics, while sku5 affects a protein linked to the plasma membrane and cell wall. Root behavior and gene expression patterns (transcriptomics) were analyzed for seedlings at 4 and 8 days of growth.\n\nResults: The spr1 mutant showed fewer differentially expressed genes in spaceflight compared to its wild-type, suggesting a less intense transcriptional response. In contrast, the sku5 mutant showed considerably more differentially expressed genes than its wild-type, indicating a stronger stress response, particularly in younger (4-day-old) seedlings. These differences demonstrate that the two mutations have unique and opposing effects on the plant's physiological adaptation to spaceflight.\n\nConclusions: The study concludes that the two skewing pathways represented by SKU5 and SPR1 have distinct contributions to spaceflight adaptation. The less intense response of the spr1 mutant suggests that the loss of its function may be beneficial for acclimation. Conversely, the intense response of the sku5 mutant suggests that proper SKU5 function is important for spaceflight adaptation.

To address this deficiency, articular cartilage (AC) and sternal cartilage (SC) from mice exposed to 30 days of microgravity on the BION-M1 craft were investigated for pathological changes. The flight AC showed some evidence of degradation at the tissue level with loss of proteoglycan staining and a reduction in mRNA expression of mechano-responsive and structural cartilage matrix proteins compared to non-flight controls. These data suggest that degradative changes are underway in the AC extracellular matrix exposed to microgravity. In contrast, there was no evidence of cartilage breakdown in SC flight samples and the gene expression profile was distinct from that of AC with a reduction in metalloproteinase gene transcription. Since the two cartilages respond differently to microgravity we propose that each is tuned to the biomechanical environments in which they are normally maintained. That is, the differences between magnitude of normal terrestrial loading and the unloading of microgravity dictates the tissue response. Weight-bearing articular cartilage, but not minimally loaded sternal fibrocartilage, is negatively affected by the unloading of microgravity.

By examining both articular cartilage (AC) from weight-bearing joints and sternal fibrocartilage (SC) from the minimally-loaded sternum of mice after a 30-day mission, researchers found that only the weight-bearing cartilage showed signs of degradation. This finding suggests that the negative effects of microgravity on cartilage are primarily dictated by the degree of unloading from the tissue's normal terrestrial state, a crucial insight for developing countermeasures for astronauts.",
        "Summary": "Background: The effects of spaceflight on cartilaginous structures are largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate whether microgravity exposure would cause pathological changes in two different types of cartilage: articular cartilage (AC) from a weight-bearing joint, and sternal cartilage (SC), which is minimally loaded.\n\nMethods: Articular cartilage and sternal cartilage were collected from mice after a 30-day microgravity exposure on the BION-M1 mission. The tissues were investigated for pathological changes using histology (to assess proteoglycan staining) and for changes in gene expression (mRNA) of key cartilage matrix proteins and metalloproteinases.\n\nResults: The flight articular cartilage showed evidence of degradation, including a loss of proteoglycan staining and a reduction in the mRNA expression of mechano-responsive and structural matrix proteins compared to non-flight controls. In stark contrast, the sternal cartilage from the flight samples showed no evidence of breakdown. The gene expression profile in the SC was also distinct from that of the AC, with a reduction in the transcription of metalloproteinase genes.\n\nConclusions: The two types of cartilage responded differently to microgravity. The authors propose that this difference is because each cartilage type is tuned to its normal biomechanical environment on Earth. The weight-bearing articular cartilage was negatively affected by the unloading of microgravity, while the minimally loaded sternal fibrocartilage was not. This suggests that maintaining physiological loading on AC during spaceflight could minimize damage."

One such stressor, microgravity, has been shown to alter host-microbe interactions at the genetic and physiological levels. Recent sequencing of the microbiomes associated with plants and animals have shown that these interactions are essential for maintaining host health through the regulation of several metabolic and immune responses. Disruptions to various environmental parameters or community characteristics may impact the resiliency of the microbiome, thus potentially driving host-microbe associations towards disease. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of host-microbe interactions in microgravity and assess the impact of this unique environmental stress on the normal physiological and genetic responses of both pathogenic and mutualistic associations. As humans move beyond our biosphere and undergo longer duration space flights, it will be essential to more fully understand microbial fitness in microgravity conditions in order to maintain a healthy homeostasis between humans, plants and their respective microbiomes.",

        "Summary": "Background: Spaceflight imposes unique stresses, particularly microgravity, which can have a profound impact on the balance between eukaryotic organisms and their associated microbes. As these microbiomes are essential for host health, understanding how they are disrupted by spaceflight is critical.\n\nMethods: This is a review article. The authors discuss the current understanding of host-microbe interactions in microgravity by summarizing genetic and physiological studies on both pathogenic (disease-causing) and mutualistic (beneficial) associations.\n\nResults: The review consolidates findings showing that microgravity can alter gene expression and physiology in both hosts and their microbes. These disruptions can impact the resiliency of the microbiome and potentially shift host-microbe associations toward a disease state, affecting the host's metabolic and immune responses.\n\nConclusions: The abstract concludes that as humans embark on longer-duration spaceflights, a more complete understanding of microbial fitness in microgravity is essential. This knowledge is necessary to develop strategies to maintain a healthy homeostasis between humans, their food crops, and their respective microbiomes."

        "Abstract": "Summary Recent research has shown that the microbiota affects the biology of associated host epithelial tissues, including their circadian rhythms, although few data are available on how such influences shape the microarchitecture of the brush border. The squid-vibrio system exhibits two modifications of the brush border that supports the symbionts: effacement and repolarization. Together these occur on a daily rhythm in adult animals, at the dawn expulsion of symbionts into the environment, and symbiont colonization of the juvenile host induces an increase in microvillar density. Here we sought to define how these processes are related and the roles of both symbiont colonization and environmental cues. Ultrastructural analyses showed that the juvenile-organ brush borders also efface concomitantly with daily dawn-cued expulsion of symbionts. Manipulation of the environmental light cue and juvenile symbiotic state demonstrated that this behaviour requires the light cue, but not colonization. In contrast, symbionts were required for the observed increase in microvillar density that accompanies post dawn brush-border repolarization; this increase was induced solely by host exposure to phosphorylated lipid A of symbiont cells. These data demonstrate that a partnering of environmental and symbiont cues shapes the brush border and that microbe-associated molecular patterns play a role in the regulation of brush-border microarchitecture.",

Using the squid-vibrio light organ model, researchers show that a daily, dawn-cued effacement (shedding) of the brush border is controlled by light, but the subsequent repolarization and increase in microvillar density requires a specific molecule from the symbiont bacteria (lipid A). This is a significant finding in host-microbe interactions, demonstrating how external and internal signals are integrated to shape the microarchitecture of epithelial tissues.",
        "Summary": "Background: The microbiota is known to affect the biology of host epithelial tissues, including their daily rhythms. This study sought to define how symbiont colonization and environmental cues (like light) regulate the daily remodeling of the microvillar brush border in the Euprymna scolopes light organ, which supports its symbiotic bacteria.\n\nMethods: The researchers used ultrastructural analysis to observe the brush borders of both juvenile and adult squid light organs. They manipulated the environmental light cue and the symbiotic state of juvenile squid to determine the roles of light and bacterial colonization. They also exposed the host to specific microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), such as phosphorylated lipid A from the symbiont, to see if they could induce the remodeling process.\n\nResults: The study showed that the juvenile light organ brush borders also undergo a daily effacement (shedding) at dawn, similar to adults. This process required the light cue but did not require the presence of the symbiotic bacteria. In contrast, the subsequent increase in microvillar density that occurred during brush-border repolarization was dependent on the symbionts. This increase could be induced solely by exposing the host to the symbiont's phosphorylated lipid A.\n\nConclusions: The data demonstrate that a partnership of environmental (light) and symbiont (lipid A) cues shapes the brush border. This reveals that microbe-associated molecular patterns can play a direct role in regulating the microarchitecture of host epithelial tissues."

We analyzed the genome of Euprymna scolopes, a model cephalopod, and observed large-scale genomic reorganizations compared with the ancestral bilaterian genome. We report distinct evolutionary signatures within the two symbiotic organs of E. scolopes, the light organ (LO) and the accessory nidamental gland (ANG). The LO evolved through subfunctionalization of genes expressed in the eye, indicating a deep evolutionary link between these organs. Alternatively, the ANG was enriched in novel, species-specific orphan genes suggesting these two tissues originated via different evolutionary strategies. These analyses represent the first genomic insights into the evolution of multiple symbiotic organs within a single animal host.",
        "Conclusion": "Our analyses of the Hawaiian bobtail squid genome revealed large-scale genome reorganization, which preceded the coleoid cephalopod radiation, and provide evidence for two different patterns of genomic evolution that contributed to functional novelty. First, the extensive structural reorganization through the loss of ancient bilaterian microsynteny and increase in genome size through repetitive element expansions resulted in a unique genomic architecture that may have contributed to the innovations in the general cephalopod body plan. Second, the coding and surrounding regulatory regions of microbe-associated tissues suggest distinctive evolutionary patterns, such as the expansion of genes associated with immunity and light production in the LO. In the ANG, the prevalence of taxon-specific, or orphan, gene expression suggests a highly derived organ that evolved by a different means than the LO, perhaps due to unique selection pressures. Overall, our results set the stage for further functional analysis of genomic innovations that led to the evolution of symbiotic organs in a morphologically and behaviorally complex clade.",

Here, the impact of modeled microgravity on the shedding of Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides (LPS) by the symbiotic bacterium Vibrio fischeri was examined using high-aspect ratio vessels. LPS from V. fischeri is known to induce developmental apoptosis within its symbiotic tissues, which is accelerated under modeled microgravity conditions. In this study, we provide evidence that exposure to modeled microgravity increases the amount of LPS released by the bacterial symbiont in vitro. The higher rates of shedding under modeled microgravity conditions are associated with increased production of outer-membrane vesicles (OMV), which has been previously correlated to flagellar motility. Mutants of V. fischeri defective in the production and rotation of their flagella show significant decreases in LPS shedding in all treatments, but levels of LPS are higher under modeled microgravity despite loss of motility. Modeled microgravity also appears to affect the outer-membrane integrity of V. fischeri, as cells incubated under modeled microgravity conditions are more susceptible to cell-membrane-disrupting agents. These results suggest that, like their animal hosts, the physiology of symbiotic microbes can be altered under microgravity-like conditions, which may have important implications for host health during spaceflight.",

Researchers found that the symbiotic bacterium Vibrio fischeri, when grown in modeled microgravity, releases more lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and outer-membrane vesicles (OMVs). Since V. fischeri LPS is a key signal in its symbiotic relationship, this change could alter the host's normal developmental processes, highlighting that the health of symbiotic microbes is a critical factor for animal health during spaceflight.",

This study examined the effect of modeled microgravity on the shedding of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by the symbiotic bacterium Vibrio fischeri, as its LPS is known to induce developmental apoptosis in its squid host.\n\nMethods: V. fischeri was cultured in high-aspect ratio vessels under both normal gravity and modeled microgravity conditions. The amount of LPS released by the bacteria was measured. The production of outer-membrane vesicles (OMVs) was also assessed. Mutants of V. fischeri defective in flagellar production and rotation were used to investigate the role of motility. The integrity of the outer membrane was tested by exposing the cells to membrane-disrupting agents.\n\nResults: Exposure to modeled microgravity increased the amount of LPS released by V. fischeri. This was associated with an increased production of OMVs. While mutants lacking flagella showed a significant decrease in LPS shedding overall, the levels of LPS were still higher under modeled microgravity compared to normal gravity. Additionally, cells grown in modeled microgravity were more susceptible to membrane-disrupting agents, suggesting an effect on outer-membrane integrity.\n\nConclusions: The results suggest that the physiology of symbiotic microbes, like that of their animal hosts, can be altered by microgravity-like conditions. The increased shedding of LPS, a key signaling molecule, may have important implications for host health and development during spaceflight."

        "Abstract": "BackgroundSpaceflight is a novel and profoundly stressful environment for life. One aspect of spaceflight, microgravity, has been shown to perturb animal physiology thereby posing numerous health risks, including dysregulation of normal developmental pathways. Microgravity can also negatively impact the interactions between animals and their microbiomes. However, the effects of microgravity on developmental processes influenced by beneficial microbes, such as apoptosis, remains poorly understood. Here, the binary mutualism between the bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, and the gram-negative bacterium, Vibrio fischeri, was studied under modeled microgravity conditions to elucidate how this unique stressor alters apoptotic cell death induced by beneficial microbes. ResultsAnalysis of the host genome and transcriptome revealed a complex network of apoptosis genes affiliated with extrinsic/receptor-mediated and intrinsic/stress-induced apoptosis. Expression of apoptosis genes under modeled microgravity conditions occurred earlier and at high levels compared to gravity controls, in particular the expression of genes encoding initiator and executioner caspases. Functional assays of these apoptotic proteases revealed heightened activity under modeled microgravity; however, these increases could be mitigated using caspase inhibitors. ConclusionsThe outcomes of this study indicated that modeled microgravity alters the expression of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis gene expression and that this process is mediated in part by caspases. Modeled microgravity-associated increases of caspase activity can be pharmacologically inhibited suggesting that perturbations to the normal apoptosis signaling cascade can be mitigated, which may have broader implications for maintaining animal-microbial homeostasis in spaceflight.

        "Conclusion": "Taken together, these results suggest that external stresses, such as modeled microgravity, can cause perturbations to the normal apoptotic pathways in animals. As many of the mechanisms that E. scolopes use to communicate with V. fischeri are present in other animals (e.g., Lbps) this research provides a framework for understanding how animals respond differentially to the stresses of spaceflight in the presence and absence of their symbionts. For spaceflight, understanding how disruptions in host-microbe homeostasis and animal physiology alter normal physiological responses, such as apoptosis, is critical. Furthermore, the ability to modulate the life or death of a cell as well as identify mitigation targets or strategies to prevent perturbations of animal-microbe homeostasis has immense therapeutic potential for maintaining crew health for long-duration spaceflight.",

Functional assays were used to measure the activity of caspases (key apoptotic proteases), and caspase inhibitors were used to test if the effects could be blocked.\n\nResults: The analysis revealed a complex network of apoptosis genes in the squid. Under modeled microgravity, the expression of these genes occurred earlier and at higher levels than in controls, with a notable increase in initiator and executioner caspase genes. Functional assays confirmed that caspase activity was indeed heightened under modeled microgravity. This increased activity could be successfully mitigated by the use of caspase inhibitors.\n\nConclusions: The study indicates that modeled microgravity alters the expression of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways and that this process is mediated by caspases.

We hypothesized that in vitro culture duration and medium additives can individually and interactively influence the structure, composition, mechanical, and molecular properties of engineered tissues based on hMSCs and 3D poly(\u025b-caprolactone). Bone marrow hMSCs were suspended in collagen gel, seeded on scaffolds, and cultured for 1, 21, or 45 days under chondrogenic and/or osteogenic conditions. Structure, composition, biomechanics, and gene expression were analyzed. In chondrogenic medium, cartilaginous tissue formed by day 21, and hypertrophic mineralization was observed in the newly formed extracellular matrix at the interface with underlying scaffold by day 45. Glycosaminoglycan, hydroxyproline, and calcium contents, and alkaline phosphatase activity depended on culture duration and medium additives, with significant interactive effects (all p < 0.0001). The 45-day constructs exhibited mechanical properties on the order of magnitude of native articular cartilage (aggregate, Young's, and shear moduli of 0.15, 0.12, and 0.033 MPa, respectively). Gene expression was characteristic of chondrogenesis and endochondral bone formation, with sequential regulation of Sox-9, collagen type II, aggrecan, core binding factor alpha 1 (Cbf\u03b11)/Runx2, bone sialoprotein, bone morphogenetic protein-2, and osteocalcin. In contrast, osteogenic medium produced limited osteogenesis. Long-term culture of hMSC on 3D scaffolds resulted in chondrogenesis and regional mineralization at the interface between soft, newly formed engineered cartilage, and stiffer underlying scaffold. These findings merit consideration when developing grafts for osteochondral defect repair.",

        "Overview": "This study provides a detailed, long-term view of the developmental process that occurs when human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are cultured on 3D scaffolds, a process highly relevant to osteochondral defect repair. Researchers observed a sequential progression from chondrogenesis (cartilage formation) at day 21 to hypertrophic mineralization at the cartilage-scaffold interface by day 45. This recapitulation of endochondral bone formation, complete with cartilage-like mechanical properties and a predictable gene expression cascade, offers important insights for developing grafts that can integrate both cartilage and bone.",
        "Summary": "Background: Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and 3D woven poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds are promising tools for skeletal tissue engineering. This study hypothesized that culture duration and medium additives would influence the properties of tissues engineered from this combination.\n\nMethods: Bone marrow-derived hMSCs were seeded on 3D PCL scaffolds and cultured for up to 45 days under either chondrogenic (cartilage-forming) or osteogenic (bone-forming) conditions. The researchers analyzed the structure, biochemical composition (GAG, collagen, calcium), mechanical properties, and gene expression of the engineered constructs at different time points.\n\nResults: In chondrogenic medium, cartilaginous tissue formed by day 21. By day 45, hypertrophic mineralization was observed in the newly formed matrix at the interface with the scaffold. The 45-day constructs exhibited mechanical properties on the order of magnitude of native articular cartilage. Gene expression analysis showed a sequential regulation of genes characteristic of chondrogenesis and endochondral bone formation (Sox-9, collagen II, Runx2, osteocalcin, etc.). In contrast, osteogenic medium produced only limited bone formation.\n\nConclusions: The findings show that long-term culture of hMSCs on 3D scaffolds in chondrogenic medium leads to a process that mimics endochondral ossification, with chondrogenesis followed by regional mineralization at the interface with the stiffer scaffold. This observation is important for the development of grafts for osteochondral (cartilage and bone) defect repair."

        "Abstract": "The ISS rodent habitat has provided crucial insights into the impact of spaceflight on mammals, inducing symptoms characteristic of liver disease, insulin resistance, osteopenia, and myopathy. Although these physiological responses can involve the microbiome on Earth, host-microbiota interactions during spaceflight are still being elucidated. We explore murine gut microbiota and host gene expression in the colon and liver after 29 and 56 days of spaceflight using multiomics. Metagenomics revealed significant changes in 44 microbiome species, including relative reductions in bile acid and butyrate metabolising bacteria like Extibacter muris and Dysosmobacter welbionis. Functional prediction indicate over-representation of fatty acid and bile acid metabolism, extracellular matrix interactions, and antibiotic resistance genes. Host gene expression described corresponding changes to bile acid and energy metabolism, and immune suppression. These changes imply that interactions at the host-gut microbiome interface contribute to spaceflight pathology and that these interactions might critically influence human health and long-duration spaceflight feasibility.",
        "Conclusion": "Through metagenomic assessment of the murine gut microbiome, significant spaceflight-associated changes in bacteria linked to bile and fatty acid metabolism were identified. These changes in relative abundance were largely consistent in two groups of mice after spaceflight when compared to different on-Earth control groups at different timepoints as well as when using distinct metagenomic methodologies. The microbiome changes coincided with substantial changes to gene expression at the host-gut microbiome interface which are critical to barrier function, microbe interactions and bile acid transport in the intestine. These interactions suggest disruption of the signals, metabolites, and immune factors exchanged across the gut-liver axis which are likely to drive glucose and lipid dysregulation. Collectively, these multiomic findings suggest host-gut microbiome interactions during spaceflight are likely to underly widespread changes to host physiology which could pose a risk to health.",

Host gene expression (transcriptomics) was analyzed in the colon and liver tissues to identify corresponding changes.\n\nResults: Metagenomic analysis revealed significant changes in 44 microbiome species, notably a reduction in bacteria that metabolize bile acids and produce butyrate (e.g., Extibacter muris). Functional prediction indicated an over-representation of microbial genes for fatty acid and bile acid metabolism. Correspondingly, host gene expression analysis in the colon and liver showed changes in bile acid and energy metabolism pathways, as well as signs of immune suppression.\n\nConclusions: The study concludes that interactions at the host-gut microbiome interface likely contribute to the pathology observed during spaceflight.

        "Abstract": "While studies have shown an increase in pathogenicity in several microbes during spaceflight and after exposure to simulated microgravity, the mechanisms underlying these changes in phenotype are not understood across different pathogens, particularly in opportunistic pathogens. This study evaluates the mechanism for increased virulence of the opportunistic gram-negative bacterium, Serratia marcescens, in simulated microgravity. Low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) is used in ground-based studies to simulate the effects of microgravity as experienced in spaceflight. Our previous findings showed that there was a significant increase in mortality rates of the Drosophila melanogaster host when infected with either spaceflight or LSMMG treated S. marcescens. Here, we report that LSMMG increases asparagine uptake and synthesis in S. marcescens and that the increased host lethality induced by LSMMG bacteria grown in rich media can be recapitulated in minimal media by adding only aspartate and glutamine, the substrates of asparagine biosynthesis. Interestingly, increased bacterial growth rate alone is not sufficient to contribute to maximal host lethality, since the addition of aspartate to minimal media caused an LSMMG-specific increase in bacterial growth rate that is comparable to that induced by the combination of aspartate and glutamine, but this increase in growth does not cause an equivalent rate of host mortality. However, the addition of both aspartate and glutamine cause both an increase in host mortality and an overexpression of asparagine pathway genes in a LSMMG-dependent manner. We also report that L-asparaginase-mediated breakdown of asparagine is an effective countermeasure for the increased host mortality caused by LSMMG-treated bacteria. This investigation underscores the importance of the asparagine utilization pathway by helping uncover molecular mechanisms that underlie increased mortality rates of a model host infected with microgravity-treated S. marcescens and provides a potential mitigation strategy.",

        "Overview": "This study uncovers a key molecular mechanism for the increased virulence of the bacterium Serratia marcescens in simulated microgravity, a finding with important implications for astronaut health. Researchers found that low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) increases the bacterium's asparagine uptake and synthesis. This metabolic shift, rather than just faster growth, is shown to be the primary driver of increased host lethality. Crucially, the study also identifies a potential countermeasure: L-asparaginase, an enzyme that breaks down asparagine, effectively reversed the increased mortality.",
        "Summary": "Background: While it is known that simulated microgravity can increase the pathogenicity of some microbes, the underlying molecular mechanisms are often unclear. Previous work showed that Serratia marcescens becomes more lethal to its Drosophila host after exposure to low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG).\n\nMethods: S. marcescens was grown in rich and minimal media under LSMMG conditions. The effect of adding specific amino acids (aspartate and glutamine, precursors for asparagine) on bacterial growth and host mortality was tested. Gene expression of the asparagine pathway was measured. The enzyme L-asparaginase was used as a potential countermeasure to test its ability to reduce host mortality.\n\nResults: The study found that LSMMG increases asparagine uptake and synthesis in S. marcescens. The increased host lethality seen in rich media could be replicated in minimal media by adding only the precursors for asparagine synthesis. While adding aspartate alone increased the bacterial growth rate, it was not sufficient to cause maximal host lethality; the addition of both aspartate and glutamine was required. This combination also led to the overexpression of asparagine pathway genes. Treating the infection with L-asparaginase was an effective countermeasure against the increased host mortality.\n\nConclusions: The study underscores the importance of the asparagine utilization pathway in the increased virulence of S. marcescens treated with simulated microgravity. It identifies a specific molecular mechanism and provides a potential mitigation strategy."

        "Abstract": "A single strain from the family Paenibacillaceae was isolated from the wall behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in April 2018, as part of the Microbial Tracking mission series. This strain was identified as a gram-positive, rod-shaped, oxidase-positive, catalase-negative motile bacterium in the genus Cohnella, designated as F6_2S_P_1T. The 16S sequence of the F6_2S_P_1T strain places it in a clade with C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli, which were originally isolated from plant tissue or rhizosphere environments. The closest 16S and gyrB matches to strain F6_2S_P_1T are to C. rhizosphaerae with 98.84 and 93.99% sequence similarity, while a core single-copy gene phylogeny from all publicly available Cohnella genomes places it as more closely related to C. ginsengisoli. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA\u2013DNA hybridization (dDDH) values to any described Cohnella species are <89 and <22%, respectively. The major fatty acids for strain F6_2S_P_1T are anteiso-C15:0 (51.7%), iso-C16:0 (23.1%), and iso-C15:0 (10.5%), and it is able to metabolize a wide range of carbon compounds. Given the results of the ANI and dDDH analyses, this ISS strain is a novel species within the genus Cohnella for which we propose the name Cohnella hashimotonis, with the type strain F6_2S_P_1T (=NRRL B-65657T and DSMZ 115098T). Because no closely related Cohnella genomes were available, this study generated the whole-genome sequences (WGSs) of the type strains for C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli. Phylogenetic and pangenomic analysis reveals that F6_2S_P_1T, C. rhizosphaerae, and C. ginsengisoli, along with two uncharacterized Cohnella strains, possess a shared set of 332 gene clusters which are not shared with any other WGS of Cohnella species, and form a distinct clade branching off from C. nanjingensis. Functional traits were predicted for the genomes of strain F6_2S_P_1T and other members of this clade.",
        "Conclusion": "We used multiple means of characterization, including phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional genome-prediction methods to characterize Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T and place it within the established taxonomy of the genus Cohnella. Based on these data, we propose that this novel species be named C. hashimotonis. We also characterized the branch of Cohnella within which C. hashimotonis is placed and predicted functional characteristics of C. hashimotonis and the C. ginsengisoli clade as a whole. All species of Cohnella closely related to C. hashimotonis are from the plant/rhizosphere environment and likely have mutualistic associations with plant roots or other tissue. It is likely, therefore, that C. hashimotonis was introduced to the ISS not as a human commensal but as a plant commensal during one of the many plant growth experiments conducted on board. Nevertheless, C. hashimotonis can clearly survive in the extreme conditions of the ISS built environment, including radiation exposure, desiccation, low nutrient availability, and microgravity, and is closely related to a number of rhizosphere bacteria; it is therefore a promising candidate for testing as a member of plant-growth-promoting consortia for future plant experiments in outer space.",

Whole-genome sequencing was performed on the new strain and its two closest relatives. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA\u2013DNA hybridization (dDDH) values were calculated to determine if it was a new species. Pangenomic analysis was used to predict functional traits.\n\nResults: The strain was identified as a member of the genus Cohnella. Both ANI (<89%) and dDDH (<22%) values were well below the thresholds for species delineation, confirming it as a novel species. Phylogenetic analysis placed it in a distinct clade with C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli, both of which are plant-associated. Functional predictions for this clade were generated.\n\nConclusions: Based on the comprehensive data, the authors propose the name Cohnella hashimotonis for this novel species.

        "Abstract": "BackgroundSeveral investigations on the microbial diversity and functional properties of the International Space Station (ISS) environment were carried out to understand the influence of spaceflight conditions on the microbial population. However, metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of ISS samples are yet to be generated and subjected to various genomic analyses, including phylogenetic affiliation, predicted functional pathways, antimicrobial resistance, and virulence characteristics. ResultsIn total, 46 MAGs were assembled from 21 ISS environmental metagenomes, in which metaSPAdes yielded 20 MAGs and metaWRAP generated 26 MAGs. Among 46 MAGs retrieved, 18 bacterial species were identified, including one novel genus/species combination (Kalamiella piersonii) and one novel bacterial species (Methylobacterium ajmalii). In addition, four bins exhibited fungal genomes; this is the first-time fungal genomes were assembled from ISS metagenomes. Phylogenetic analyses of five bacterial species showed ISS-specific evolution. The genes pertaining to cell membranes, such as transmembrane transport, cell wall organization, and regulation of cell shape, were enriched. Variations in the antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) and virulence genes of the selected 20 MAGs were characterized to predict the ecology and evolution of biosafety level (BSL) 2 microorganisms in space. Since microbial virulence increases in microgravity, AMR gene sequences of MAGs were compared with genomes of respective ISS isolates and corresponding type strains. Among these 20 MAGs characterized, AMR genes were more prevalent in the Enterobacter bugandensis MAG, which has been predominantly isolated from clinical samples. MAGs were further used to analyze if genes involved in AMR and biofilm formation of viable microbes in ISS have variation due to generational evolution in microgravity and radiation pressure. ConclusionsComparative analyses of MAGs and whole-genome sequences of related ISS isolates and their type strains were characterized to understand the variation related to the microbial evolution under microgravity. The Pantoea/Kalamiella strains have the maximum single-nucleotide polymorphisms found within the ISS strains examined. This may suggest that Pantoea/Kalamiella strains are much more subjective to microgravity changes. The reconstructed genomes will enable researchers to study the evolution of genomes under microgravity and low-dose irradiation compared to the evolution of microbes here on Earth. Video Abstract Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40168-023-01545-7.",
        "Conclusion": "In summary, good quality bacterial and fungal MAGs were generated from ISS environmental samples, and functional properties were predicted. Furthermore, it was possible to describe novel microbial (two bacterial and one yeast) species via the \u201cmetagenome to phenome\u201d approach. The monophyletic phylogeny exhibited by the ISS genomes (both isolates and MAGs) suggested that they shared a single common ancestor. The molecules pertaining to the cell membranes, such as transmembrane transport, cell wall organization, and regulation of cell shape, were in high frequency in ISS genomes demonstrating evidence for ISS-specific bacterial evolution. The common gene-based resistance phenomenon noticed in this study suggests that SNP changes in MAGs and ISS genomes might be an adaptation strategy in AMR and biofilm formation in microbes. Similarly, variations found in the AMR and virulence genes enabled the prediction of the ecology and evolution of microorganisms in space. The maximum SNPs characterized for the ISS Pantoea/Kalamiella strains suggested that enterobacterial species are much more subjective to microgravity changes. However, fixation of environmental samples in space for RNAseq approach and/or in situ sequencing in space are warranted to confirm variation related to microbial evolution under microgravity.

This metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) approach allowed for the identification of novel species and provided insights into ISS-specific microbial evolution. By comparing the MAGs to cultured isolates, the research highlights how microbes may be adapting to the unique pressures of the space environment, particularly in relation to antimicrobial resistance and biofilm formation.",
        "Summary": "Background: While the microbial diversity on the International Space Station (ISS) has been studied, the reconstruction of genomes directly from environmental samples (metagenome-assembled genomes or MAGs) had not been done. This approach can reveal the genomic potential of uncultivated microbes and provide insights into their evolution.\n\nMethods: Researchers used 21 ISS environmental metagenomes to assemble 46 MAGs. These MAGs were then subjected to various genomic analyses, including phylogenetic classification, prediction of functional pathways, and screening for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and virulence genes. The MAGs were also compared to the whole-genome sequences of related ISS isolates and their type strains to look for evidence of evolution, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).\n\nResults: The study identified 18 bacterial species, including one novel genus/species (Kalamiella piersonii) and one novel species (Methylobacterium ajmalii), from the MAGs. For the first time, four fungal MAGs were also assembled from ISS metagenomes. Phylogenetic analyses of five bacterial species suggested ISS-specific evolution. Genes related to cell membranes were enriched, and variations in AMR and virulence genes were characterized. The Enterobacter bugandensis MAG was particularly rich in AMR genes. A high number of SNPs in Pantoea/Kalamiella strains suggested they are highly subject to microgravity-induced changes.\n\nConclusions: This study successfully demonstrates the use of MAGs to characterize the genomic landscape of the ISS microbiome, including the discovery of novel species. The comparative analyses provide evidence of microbial evolution under microgravity, and the reconstructed genomes will enable future research into how microbes adapt to the space environment."

        "Abstract": "Abstract The microbiome of the built environment comprises bacterial, archaeal, fungal, and viral communities associated with human-made structures. Even though most of these microbes are benign, antibiotic-resistant pathogens can colonize and emerge indoors, creating infection risk through surface transmission or inhalation. Several studies have catalogued the microbial composition and ecology in different built environment types. These have informed in vitro studies that seek to replicate the physicochemical features that promote pathogenic survival and transmission, ultimately facilitating the development and validation of intervention techniques used to reduce pathogen accumulation. Such interventions include using Bacillus-based cleaning products on surfaces or integrating bacilli into printable materials. Though this work is in its infancy, early research suggests the potential to use microbial biocontrol to reduce hospital- and home-acquired multidrug-resistant infections. Although these techniques hold promise, there is an urgent need to better understand the microbial ecology of built environments and to determine how these biocontrol solutions alter species interactions. This review covers our current understanding of microbial ecology of the built environment and proposes strategies to translate that knowledge into effective biocontrol of antibiotic-resistant pathogens.",
        "Conclusion": "Probiotic intervention studies in hospitals [22-24, 99, 100] have demonstrated the potential to revolutionize cleaning approaches in healthcare facilities. However, much is still unknown about their mechanism of action, as well as how additional factors could influence their efficaciousness in situ. Further investigation of how spores germinate and competitively exclude other microbes in these dry, nutrient-depleted environments is needed for the successful development and broad deployment of probiotic cleaners. To answer these questions, we must use a variety of experimental strategies, including varied application methods (i.e. how the cleaner is applied and at what concentration is the cleaner most effective), inclusion of taxonomically diverse pathogenic microbes at varied concentrations, and a characterization of whole community dynamics in response to cleaner application. These experiments will require highly controlled and easily manipulatable conditions, and therefore, laboratory testing will be essential for determining the relative importance of factors associated with method of use, humidity, nutrient availability, surface material type, and cleaning regimes. Further, simulating transmission events of microbes from surfaces to humans will be needed to more fully understand how probiotic cleaners influence transmission rates of taxa of interest. Differential use patterns of healthcare facilities might alter best practices for probiotic cleaner use. For example, it is unknown how the magnitude of response might vary between different wards or rooms. Patient rooms and bathrooms have been the primary focus of intervention studies; however, other shared spaces, such as hallways or visitor areas, also carry the potential for pathogen accumulation and transmission risk. Additionally, long-term monitoring is crucial to detect whether the pathogens in these environments begin to adapt to this new cleaning method and therefore become resistant to biocontrol. Such a situation could start an evolutionary \u201carms race\u201d with unknown outcomes. It is crucial to consider the health and emotional impacts on the patients and staff. Sociological studies on healthcare workers and patients are necessary to understand the perception that patients, staff, and the public have about the use of these novel products and to involve their feedback in product design and application. The popularity of probiotics in popular foods and drinks could help alleviate concerns, but deploying them in hospitals, especially around high-risk patients, will likely be controversial. Understanding the perception of these products, and explaining how and why they work, will aid in successful widespread adoption across healthcare systems. As seen in studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, harsh cleaning treatments using bleach may inhibit the probiotic and phage cleaners, so it will be imperative that staff are trained in how to properly treat surfaces cleaned with probiotics. Beyond direct application to the engineering of probiotic materials [85], 3D printing is primed to be the future of microbial biocontrol in built environments. Recent advances in 3D printing have resulted in materials that can be printed at low enough temperatures that spores and even live bacteria are not harmed during the assembly process. Unlike previous efforts, which used hydrogels [85], these new approaches can enable the printing of ceramics or hard plastics with improved utility as building materials. Using genome-enabled metabolic modelling to select bacteria that are optimized for these printing processes presents unique opportunities for built environment-specific designs that could be used to manipulate the ecology of these environments in prescribed ways. If this trend continues, we may soon be able to print tiles, furniture, or even entire structures out of sustainably produced microbially active materials [97]. Establishing the efficacy of these products through well-designed field intervention studies that are informed by lab-based experiments is an exciting subfield of built environment microbiome research and will ultimately lead to better products, building materials, and design techniques in buildings to improve occupant health and well-being.",

It highlights the promise of probiotic cleaners and engineered microbial materials. However, it also emphasizes that our understanding of the complex microbial interactions in these environments is still in its infancy.\n\nConclusions: The authors conclude that while probiotic interventions are a promising future for cleaning and building design, much more research is needed. They call for a better understanding of the microbial ecology of built environments and more controlled studies to determine how biocontrol solutions actually work and how they alter community dynamics. This knowledge is essential for the successful and broad deployment of these novel strategies."

Factors stimulating ATP release include wounding, osmotic stress and elicitors. Here we show that exogenous abscisic acid and L-glutamate can also cause ATP accumulation around Arabidopsis thaliana roots. Release of ADP from root epidermis would trigger ionotropic receptor-like activity in the plasma membrane, resulting in transient elevation of cytosolic free calcium. Root epidermal protoplasts (expressing aequorin as a cytosolic free calcium reporter) can support an extracellular ADP-induced cytosolic calcium elevation in the presence of an extracellular reductant. This confirms that ADP could elicit calcium-based responses distinct to those of ATP, which have been shown previously to involve production of extracellular reactive oxygen species.",

        "Overview": "This study adds a new layer to our understanding of plant signaling by demonstrating that common plant stressors, like the hormone abscisic acid and the neurotransmitter-like molecule L-glutamate, can trigger the release of ATP into the extracellular space. This extracellular ATP and ADP can then act as signaling molecules, eliciting a transient elevation of cytosolic free calcium in root cells. This is an important finding as it identifies a mechanism by which diverse stress signals can be converted into a universal calcium-based response, a fundamental process in plant adaptation.",
        "Summary": "Background: Extracellular purine nucleotides like ATP and ADP are known to act as signaling molecules in plants, regulating development and stress responses, in part by triggering an influx of calcium into the cell. While factors like wounding and osmotic stress were known to cause ATP release, the triggers for this release are not fully understood.\n\nMethods: The researchers used Arabidopsis thaliana roots to investigate what stimulates ATP accumulation in the extracellular space. They also used root epidermal protoplasts expressing aequorin (a calcium reporter) to measure the elevation of cytosolic free calcium in response to extracellular ADP.\n\nResults: The study showed that both exogenous abscisic acid (a stress hormone) and L-glutamate can cause the accumulation of ATP around Arabidopsis roots. It was also demonstrated that extracellular ADP could trigger an elevation of cytosolic calcium in root epidermal protoplasts, confirming its role as a signaling molecule. This ADP-induced calcium response was found to be distinct from previously characterized ATP-induced responses that involve the production of reactive oxygen species.\n\nConclusions: The study identifies abscisic acid and L-glutamate as new triggers for the release of extracellular ATP in roots. It confirms that extracellular ADP can elicit calcium-based signaling, providing further evidence for the role of purine nucleotides as key signaling molecules that allow plants to respond to a variety of environmental and developmental cues."

They applied a localized salt stress to the roots of the plant and then imaged the propagation of Ca2+ signals throughout the root and up into the shoot.\n\nResults: The study documented a previously unreported plant-wide signaling system. A local salt stress on the root triggered a wave of elevated cytosolic Ca2+ that propagated long distances through the cortical and endodermal cell layers of the root at very high speeds (up to 400 \u00b5m/s). This rapid Ca2+ wave was shown to correlate with the triggering of molecular stress responses in distant parts of the plant, such as the leaves.\n\nConclusions: The propagating Ca2+ waves provide a new mechanism for the rapid integration of activities and responses throughout the plant body. This system acts as a form of rapid, long-distance communication that allows the entire plant to respond to a localized stress."

Furthermore, the researchers showed that mechanosensing induces a calcium signal that is both required and sufficient to antagonize the ethylene signaling pathway.\n\nConclusions: The study reveals a previously unanticipated interplay between ethylene, auxin, and mechanosensing in the control of plant gravitropism. It provides a mechanism where a mechanical cue from the growth medium can override a hormonal signal to ensure proper directional root growth."

        "Overview": "This study provides compelling evidence for a physical link between amyloplasts (gravity-sensing organelles) and the vacuole in plant cells. By using the Arabidopsis mutant zigzag-1, where amyloplast movement is highly restricted, the researchers showed that treatment with wortmannin\u2014a chemical that induces vacuole fusion and alters vacuole morphology\u2014was able to overcome this restriction. This is a significant finding for understanding the cellular mechanics of gravitropism, as it suggests that the large central vacuole may play a direct role in constraining or guiding the movement of statoliths.",
        "Summary": "Background: Amyloplasts in graviperceptive cells act as statoliths, sedimenting to provide the initial gravity signal. In the Arabidopsis mutant zigzag-1 (zig-1), the movement of these amyloplasts is highly restricted. This study aimed to investigate the cause of this restriction.\n\nMethods: The researchers treated zig-1 hypocotyls with wortmannin, a chemical known to be an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol kinases which leads to the fusion of vacuoles. They then observed the movement of amyloplasts in the graviperceptive cells of these treated seedlings and compared it to untreated controls.\n\nResults: The study found that treatment with wortmannin, and the subsequent fusion and altered morphology of the vacuole, was able to overcome the highly restricted movement of amyloplasts that is characteristic of the zig-1 mutant. The amyloplasts in the treated seedlings became more mobile.\n\nConclusions: The ability of wortmannin-induced vacuole fusion to release the restricted amyloplasts suggests that there is a physical association between the amyloplasts and the vacuole (or tonoplast). This finding implies that the vacuole may play a role in the cellular machinery that controls the movement and positioning of statoliths during gravity sensing."

The authors propose a 'ROS-assisted calcium-induced calcium release' mechanism, where an initial calcium signal triggers the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn sensitizes neighboring cells to amplify and propagate the calcium signal. This is a crucial read for plant biologists, as it elucidates the molecular machinery (involving AtRBOHD and TPC1) and the positive feedback loop that drive rapid, long-distance signaling in response to stress.",
        "Summary": "Background: The abstract for this study is a single sentence. It suggests that the research aimed to understand the mechanism by which stress-induced calcium (Ca2+) waves are propagated through plants, a form of rapid long-distance signaling.\n\nMethods: The study coupled mathematical modeling with direct measurement of Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species (ROS) dynamics in plants. This likely involved using plants with fluorescent sensors for Ca2+ and ROS and then modeling the observed wave propagation to test different mechanistic hypotheses.\n\nResults: The results support a model of 'ROS-assisted calcium-induced calcium release'. In this model, an initial increase in Ca2+ triggers the production of ROS by the NADPH oxidase AtRBOHD. This ROS then helps to activate the calcium channel TPC1 in neighboring cells, leading to a further influx of Ca2+. This creates a positive feedback loop that allows the signal to propagate as a wave.\n\nConclusions: The study concludes that this ROS-assisted, calcium-induced calcium release mechanism is a key driver for the propagation of stress-induced Ca2+ waves in plants. It provides a molecular and conceptual framework for understanding this important form of rapid systemic signaling."

        "Summary": "Background: The abstract for this paper is a single sentence, indicating that the study investigates the propagation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) wave during the systemic response of Arabidopsis plants to excess light stress.\n\nMethods: The title and abstract imply that the study likely used advanced imaging techniques with fluorescent ROS sensors to visualize the propagation of the ROS signal in real-time. The researchers would have applied a localized excess light stress to one part of the plant and then tracked the movement of the ROS wave through the plant's vascular tissues (the phloem and xylem).\n\nResults: The key result, as stated in the abstract, is the direct observation of the ROS wave propagating through the vascular bundles.

The study likely concludes that the ROS wave is a critical component of a rapid signaling network that allows plants to coordinate a systemic response to localized stress.

        "Abstract": "Calcium ions are predicted to be key signaling entities during biotic interactions, with calcium signaling forming an established part of the plant defense response to microbial elicitors and to wounding caused by chewing insects, eliciting systemic calcium signals in plants. However, the role of calcium in vivo during biotic stress is still unclear. This protocol describes the use of a genetically-encoded calcium sensor to detect calcium signals in plants during feeding by a hemipteran pest. Hemipterans such as aphids pierce a small number of cells with specialized, elongated sucking mouthparts, making them the ideal tool to study calcium dynamics when a plant is faced with a biotic stress, which is distinct from a wounding response. In addition, fluorescent biosensors are revolutionizing the measurement of signaling molecules in vivo in both animals and plants. Expressing a GFP-based calcium biosensor, GCaMP3, in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana allows for the real-time imaging of plant calcium dynamics during insect feeding, with a high spatial and temporal resolution. A repeatable and robust assay has been developed using the fluorescence microscopy of detached GCaMP3 leaves, allowing for the continuous measurement of cytosolic calcium dynamics before, during, and after insect feeding. This reveals a highly-localized rapid calcium elevation around the aphid feeding site that occurs within a few minutes. The protocol can be adapted to other biotic stresses, such as additional insect species, while the use of Arabidopsis thaliana allows for the rapid generation of mutants to facilitate the molecular analysis of the phenomenon.",

A wide range of signaling molecules are trafficked through the plant, but a trio of potentially interacting messengers, reactive oxygen species (ROS), Ca2+ and electrical signaling (\u2018trio signaling\u2019) appear to form a network supporting rapid signal transmission. The molecular components underlying this rapid communication are beginning to be identified, such as the ROS producing NAPDH oxidase RBOHD, the ion channel two pore channel 1 (TPC1), and glutamate receptor-like channels GLR3.3 and GLR3.6. The plant cell wall presents a plant-specific route for possible propagation of signals from cell to cell. However, the degree to which the cell wall limits information exchange between cells via transfer of small molecules through an extracellular route, or whether it provides an environment to facilitate transmission of regulators such as ROS or H+ remains to be determined. Similarly, the role of plasmodesmata as both conduits and gatekeepers for the propagation of rapid cell-to-cell signaling remains a key open question. Regardless of how signals move from cell to cell, they help prepare distant parts of the plant for impending challenges from specific biotic or abiotic stresses.",

The authors synthesize current research on the rapid signaling 'trio' in plants. They discuss the molecular components involved, the potential routes for signal propagation (cell wall vs. plasmodesmata), and the downstream responses that are triggered.\n\nResults: The review summarizes that the rapid communication network involves a likely interplay between ROS, Ca2+, and electrical signals. Key molecular players that have been identified include the NADPH oxidase RBOHD (for ROS production), and ion channels like TPC1 and Glutamate Receptor-Like (GLR) channels (for Ca2+ and electrical signaling). The review also discusses the key open questions, such as the exact route of cell-to-cell propagation.\n\nConclusions: The signals propagated by this rapid network prepare distant parts of the plant for specific biotic or abiotic challenges.

        "Abstract": "Recent advances in the routine access to space along with increasing opportunities to perform plant growth experiments on board the International Space Station have led to an ever-increasing body of transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic data from plants experiencing spaceflight. These datasets hold great promise to help understand how plant biology reacts to this unique environment. However, analyses that mine across such expanses of data are often complex to implement, being impeded by the sheer number of potential comparisons that are possible. Complexities in how the output of these multiple parallel analyses can be presented to the researcher in an accessible and intuitive form provides further barriers to such research. Recent developments in computational systems biology have led to rapid advances in interactive data visualization environments designed to perform just such tasks. However, to date none of these tools have been tailored to the analysis of the broad-ranging plant biology spaceflight data. We have therefore developed the Test Of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome (TOAST) database (https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast) to address this gap in our capabilities. TOAST is a relational database that uses the Qlik database management software to link plant biology, spaceflight-related omics datasets, and their associated metadata. This environment helps visualize relationships across multiple levels of experiments in an easy to use gene-centric platform. TOAST draws on data from The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration\u2019s (NASA\u2019s) GeneLab and other data repositories and also connects results to a suite of web-based analytical tools to facilitate further investigation of responses to spaceflight and related stresses. The TOAST graphical user interface allows for quick comparisons between plant spaceflight experiments using real-time, gene-specific queries, or by using functional gene ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway, or other filtering systems to explore genetic networks of interest. Testing of the database shows that TOAST confirms patterns of gene expression already highlighted in the literature, such as revealing the modulation of oxidative stress-related responses across multiple plant spaceflight experiments. However, this data exploration environment can also drive new insights into patterns of spaceflight responsive gene expression. For example, TOAST analyses highlight changes to mitochondrial function as likely shared responses in many plant spaceflight experiments.",
        "Conclusion": "As the volume of spaceflight omics-level data increases, its power will lie in researchers' ability to mine both within and across multiple datasets. Such comparisons will provide an important source of hypotheses to then be experimentally tested. TOAST provides a data-rich environment with which to explore the commonalities and differences in the responses of plants to spaceflight and spaceflight-related environments in an accessible and intuitive format. The TOAST database has been released as a publicly available, web-based environment (https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast) along with an online tutorial at https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast/tutorial-metadata. At present, TOAST provides a tool to aid the plant biology community. However, the underlying TOAST architecture is biological kingdom agnostic; through use of orthologous matrix mapping, we are working to extend TOAST to facilitate similar data exploration across the wealth of biological systems that are being analyzed in spaceflight.",

We show that when the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22 is used to trigger immune responses in mutants missing tonoplast Ca2+ pumps, it causes disrupted Ca2+ signals that are higher in amplitude than expected from wild-type plants. Relocalization of a Ca2+ pump normally found in the plasma membrane to the tonoplast rescues both the tonoplast pump knockout mutant\u2019s immune-related phenotypes and aberrant Ca2+ signaling dynamics. These observations support the notion that tonoplast-localized pumps are critical for the proper maintenance of Ca2+ dynamics in innate immune responses but that any regulatory systems specific to the endogenous tonoplast pumps may not be required to support these signaling events.",

        "Overview": "This study provides a significant insight into the fine-tuning of plant immune signaling by demonstrating the critical role of vacuolar calcium pumps. Researchers showed that Arabidopsis mutants lacking these tonoplast-localized pumps exhibit disrupted and abnormally high calcium signals in response to a bacterial elicitor, leading to altered immune-related phenotypes. Importantly, they could rescue these defects by relocalizing a different calcium pump to the vacuole, indicating that the pump's location, rather than its specific regulatory features, is key for maintaining proper Ca2+ dynamics during pattern-triggered immunity.",
        "Summary": "Background: Calcium (Ca2+) signaling is closely linked to the triggering of plant immune responses. This study aimed to investigate the role of Ca2+ pumps located on the membrane of the vacuole (the tonoplast) in regulating these signals.\n\nMethods: The researchers used Arabidopsis mutants that were missing tonoplast-localized Ca2+ pumps. They triggered an immune response in these mutants using the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22 and measured the resulting cytosolic Ca2+ signals. They also created a genetic construct to relocalize a Ca2+ pump that is normally found on the plasma membrane to the tonoplast of the mutant plants to see if it could rescue the observed defects.\n\nResults: When the immune response was triggered in the mutants lacking tonoplast Ca2+ pumps, they produced disrupted Ca2+ signals that were higher in amplitude than those in wild-type plants. This aberrant signaling was associated with altered immune-related phenotypes. Remarkably, expressing a different Ca2+ pump (from the plasma membrane) on the tonoplast was sufficient to rescue both the aberrant Ca2+ signaling dynamics and the immune phenotypes of the mutant.\n\nConclusions: The observations support the notion that tonoplast-localized pumps are critical for the proper maintenance of Ca2+ dynamics during innate immune responses. The successful rescue experiment suggests that the specific regulatory systems of the endogenous tonoplast pumps may not be required for this function; rather, the simple act of pumping Ca2+ into the vacuole at the right location is the key requirement."

        "Abstract": "Plants possess a systemic signaling system whereby local stimuli can lead to rapid, plant-wide responses. In addition to the redistribution of chemical messengers that range from RNAs and peptides to hormones and metabolites, a communication system acting through the transmission of electrical, Ca2+, reactive oxygen species and potentially even hydraulic signals has also been discovered. This latter system can propagate signals across many cells each second and researchers are now beginning to uncover the molecular machineries behind this rapid communications network. Thus, elements such as the reactive oxygen species producing NAPDH oxidases and ion channels of the two pore channel, glutamate receptor-like and cyclic nucleotide gated families are all required for the rapid propagation of these signals. Upon arrival at their distant targets, these changes trigger responses ranging from the production of hormones, to changes in the levels of primary metabolites and shifts in patterns of gene expression. These systemic responses occur within seconds to minutes of perception of the initial, local signal, allowing for the rapid deployment of plant-wide responses. For example, an insect starting to chew on just a single leaf triggers preemptive antiherbivore defenses throughout the plant well before it has a chance to move on to the next leaf on its menu.",

This review focuses on a communication system that operates through the transmission of electrical, calcium (Ca2+), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signals.\n\nMethods: This is a review article. The authors summarize the current understanding of this rapid communication network, discuss the key molecular machineries that have been identified, and describe the downstream responses that are triggered in distant parts of the plant.\n\nResults: The review highlights that this rapid signaling network involves the interplay of electrical, Ca2+, and ROS signals that can propagate across many cells each second. Key molecular components that have been identified include NADPH oxidases (for ROS production) and various ion channels (such as two pore channels and glutamate receptor-like channels) for electrical and Ca2+ signaling. Upon arrival at distant targets, these signals trigger responses within seconds to minutes, including hormone production, metabolic shifts, and changes in gene expression.\n\nConclusions: This rapid signaling network allows for the quick deployment of plant-wide defensive responses.

Testing this tool on a scenario of a mission on the Moon, we identified a series of experiments conducted on the ISS with similar radiation profiles. Because the Rad-Bio-App links to GeneLab datasets, it was then straightforward to extract processed gene expression tables from GeneLab to identify common pathways that may be modified by, in this case, the lunar surface radiation environment.

Tolerance to anoxia is relevant to wetland species, rice (Oryza sativa) cultivation, and submergence tolerance of crops. Decoding and transmitting calcium (Ca) signals may be an important component to anoxia tolerance; however, the contribution of intracellular Ca transporters to this process is poorly understood. Four functional cation/proton exchangers (CAX1\u20134) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) help regulate Ca homeostasis around the vacuole. Our results demonstrate that cax1 mutants are more tolerant to both anoxic conditions and submergence. Using phenotypic measurements, RNA-sequencing, and proteomic approaches, we identified cax1-mediated anoxia changes that phenocopy changes present in anoxia-tolerant crops: altered metabolic processes, diminished reactive oxygen species production post anoxia, and altered hormone signaling. Comparing wild-type and cax1 expressing genetically encoded Ca indicators demonstrated altered cytosolic Ca signals in cax1 during reoxygenation. Anoxia-induced Ca signals around the plant vacuole are involved in the control of numerous signaling events related to adaptation to low oxygen stress. This work suggests that cax1 anoxia response pathway could be engineered to circumvent the adverse effects of flooding that impair production agriculture.",

Researchers found that Arabidopsis mutants lacking CAX1 are more tolerant to these stresses, a phenotype associated with altered metabolism, diminished reactive oxygen species production, and changes in hormone signaling.

Calcium (Ca) signaling is thought to be a key component of anoxia tolerance, but the role of intracellular Ca transporters in this process is not well understood.\n\nMethods: The study focused on the cation/proton exchanger CAX1, a transporter that helps regulate Ca homeostasis at the vacuole in Arabidopsis. The researchers tested the tolerance of cax1 mutants to both anoxic conditions and full submergence. They used RNA-sequencing and proteomic approaches to identify the molecular changes in the cax1 mutant during anoxia. They also used genetically encoded Ca indicators to visualize cytosolic Ca signals during reoxygenation.\n\nResults: The cax1 mutants were found to be significantly more tolerant to both anoxia and submergence than wild-type plants. The molecular analyses revealed that the cax1 mutant's response to anoxia phenocopied changes seen in anoxia-tolerant crops, including altered metabolic processes, reduced production of reactive oxygen species after the stress, and altered hormone signaling. The cax1 mutant also displayed altered cytosolic Ca signals during the reoxygenation phase.\n\nConclusions: The study suggests that Ca signals around the plant vacuole, regulated by transporters like CAX1, are involved in controlling numerous signaling events related to adaptation to low oxygen stress.

To better understand mechanisms involved in rapid, radiation-induced bone loss, we determined the influence of total body irradiation on expression of select cytokines known both to stimulate osteoclastogenesis and contribute to inflammatory bone disease. Adult (16 week), male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to either 2 Gy gamma rays (137Cs, 0.8 Gy/min) or heavy ions (56Fe, 600MeV, 0.50\u20131.1 Gy/min); this dose corresponds to either a single fraction of radiotherapy (typical total dose is \u226510 Gy) or accumulates over long-duration interplanetary missions. Serum, marrow, and mineralized tissue were harvested 4 h\u20147 days later. Gamma irradiation caused a prompt (2.6-fold within 4 h) and persistent (peaking at 4.1-fold within 1 day) rise in the expression of the obligate osteoclastogenic cytokine, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (Rankl), within marrow cells over controls. Similarly, Rankl expression peaked in marrow cells within 3 days of iron exposure (9.2-fold). Changes in Rankl expression induced by gamma irradiation preceded and overlapped with a rise in expression of other pro-osteoclastic cytokines in marrow (eg, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 increased by 11.9-fold, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha increased by 1.7-fold over controls). The ratio, Rankl/Opg, in marrow increased by 1.8-fold, a net pro-resorption balance. In the marrow, expression of the antioxidant transcription factor, Nfe2l2, strongly correlated with expression levels of Nfatc1, Csf1, Tnf, and Rankl. Radiation exposure increased a serum marker of bone resorption (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase) and led to cancellous bone loss (16% decrement after 1 week). We conclude that total body irradiation (gamma or heavy-ion) caused temporal elevations in the concentrations of specific genes expressed within marrow and mineralized tissue related to bone resorption, including select cytokines that lead to osteoclastogenesis and elevated resorption; this is likely to account for rapid and progressive deterioration of cancellous microarchitecture following exposure to ionizing radiation.",

Researchers demonstrated that both gamma and heavy-ion radiation cause a prompt and persistent rise in the expression of the pro-osteoclastogenic cytokine RANKL within the bone marrow.

Serum, marrow, and mineralized tissue were harvested at time points from 4 hours to 7 days later. The expression of select cytokines, particularly RANKL, was measured. A serum marker for bone resorption was also measured, and cancellous bone loss was quantified.\n\nResults: Both gamma and heavy-ion irradiation caused a rapid (within 4 hours) and persistent (peaking within 1-3 days) increase in the expression of RANKL in the marrow cells. This was accompanied by a rise in the expression of other pro-resorptive cytokines and an increase in the RANKL/OPG ratio, which favors bone resorption. The increase in these gene expression markers preceded a rise in a serum marker of bone resorption and a measurable loss of cancellous bone (16% decrement after 1 week).\n\nConclusions: The study concludes that total body irradiation causes temporal elevations in the expression of specific genes within the marrow that are related to bone resorption. The rapid increase in RANKL and other cytokines likely accounts for the increased osteoclastogenesis and the subsequent rapid deterioration of cancellous bone microarchitecture following radiation exposure."

The resources and time it takes to harvest tissues post-euthanasia, and the methods and duration of long duration storage, potentially have negative impacts on sample quantity and quality, thereby limiting the scientific outcome that can be achieved. ObjectivesThe goals of this study were to optimize methods for both sample recovery and science return from rodent experiments, with possible relevance to both ground based and spaceflight studies. The first objective was to determine the impacts of tissue harvest time post-euthanasia, preservation methods, and storage duration, focusing on RNA quality and enzyme activities in liver and spleen as indices of sample quality. The second objective was to develop methods that will maximize science return by dissecting multiple tissues after long duration storage in situ at -80\u00b0C. MethodsTissues of C57Bl/6J mice were dissected and preserved at various time points post-euthanasia and stored at -80\u00b0C for up to 11 months. In some experiments, tissues were recovered from frozen carcasses which had been stored at -80\u00b0C up to 7 months. RNA quantity and quality was assessed by measuring RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Additionally, the quality of tissues was assessed by measuring activities of hepatic enzymes (catalase, glutathione reductase and GAPDH). ResultsFresh tissues were collected up to one hour post-euthanasia, and stored up to 11 months at -80\u00b0C, with minimal adverse effects on the RNA quality of either livers or RNAlater-preserved spleens. Liver enzyme activities were similar to those of positive controls, with no significant effect observed at any time point. Tissues dissected from frozen carcasses that had been stored for up to 7 months at -80\u00b0C had variable results, depending on the specific tissue analyzed. RNA quality of liver, heart, and kidneys were minimally affected after 6\u20137 months of storage at -80\u00b0C, whereas RNA degradation was evident in tissues such as small intestine, bone, and bone marrow when they were collected from the carcasses frozen for 2.5 months. ConclusionThese results demonstrate that 1) the protocols developed for spaceflight experiments with on-orbit dissections support the retrieval of high quality samples for RNA expression and some protein analyses, despite delayed preservation post-euthanasia or prolonged storage, and 2) many additional tissues for gene expression analysis can be obtained by dissection even following prolonged storage of the tissue in situ at -80\u00b0C. These findings have relevance both to high value, ground-based experiments when sample collection capability is severely constrained, and to spaceflight experiments that entail on-orbit sample recovery by astronauts.",

It provides optimized protocols for tissue preservation that maximize scientific return, focusing on RNA quality and enzyme activity. The study validates that high-quality samples can be obtained even with delays post-euthanasia and after long-term storage.

        "Summary": "Background: In high-cost and infrequent experiments like those in space, limited resources and time can compromise the quality and quantity of tissues collected, thereby limiting the scientific outcome. This study aimed to optimize methods for sample recovery and long-term storage to maximize the science return from rodent experiments.\n\nMethods: The researchers tested the impacts of several variables on sample quality. These included the time delay between euthanasia and tissue preservation, different preservation methods, and long-term storage duration (up to 11 months at -80\u00b0C). RNA quality (RIN values) and liver enzyme activities were used as indices of sample quality. A second objective was to develop methods for dissecting multiple tissues from carcasses that had been frozen and stored at -80\u00b0C for up to 7 months.\n\nResults: High-quality RNA could be obtained from fresh livers and RNAlater-preserved spleens collected up to one hour post-euthanasia and stored for up to 11 months at -80\u00b0C. Liver enzyme activities also remained stable. For tissues dissected from frozen carcasses, the results were variable. The RNA quality of liver, heart, and kidneys was minimally affected after 6-7 months of storage, whereas significant RNA degradation was evident in tissues like the small intestine and bone marrow after just 2.5 months.\n\nConclusions: The results demonstrate that the protocols developed for spaceflight, which may involve delayed preservation and prolonged storage, can support the retrieval of high-quality samples for RNA and some protein analyses. Additionally, many tissues suitable for gene expression analysis can be obtained by dissecting carcasses after prolonged storage at -80\u00b0C, maximizing the scientific return from a single animal."

        "Abstract": "BackgroundProlonged spaceflight is known to cause vascular deconditioning and remodeling. Tail suspension, a widely used spaceflight analog, is reported to result in vascular remodeling of rats. However, little is known about the cellular atlas of the heterogeneous cells of CA and FA from hindlimb-unloaded rats. MethodsFirstly, we leveraged scRNA-seq to perform clustering analysis to identify diverse cell populations and sub-clusters within CA and FA from rats subjected to 3 months of hindlimb unloading. The dysregulated genes specific for artery types and cell types in HU group compared to Con were unraveled. Then R package \u201cCellchat\u201d was used to reveal ligand-receptor cellular communication. At last, the TF network analysis was performed using the SCENIC R package to predict the pivotal TFs in rat artery remodeling induced by hindlimb unloading. ResultsClustering analysis identified ECs, SMCs, fibroblasts, and a spectrum of immune cells, as well as neuronal and stem cells. Notably, an increased percentage of ECs in the CA and a diminished proportion of SMCs in both CA and FA were observed following tail suspension. Intersection of dysregulated genes specific for artery type and cell type after tail suspension revealed several gene sets involved in ECM remodeling, inflammation, vasoconstriction, etc. Fibroblasts, in particular, exhibited the most significant gene expression variability, highlighting their plasticity. Subclustering within ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts revealed specialized subsets engaged in processes such as EndoMT and cell cycle checkpoint regulation. Additionally, enhanced intercellular interactions among major cell types, especially between SMC and fibroblast, underscored the importance of cell communication in vascular remodeling. Several TFs were identified as potentially influential in the vascular remodeling process under simulated microgravity conditions. ConclusionsThis study presents the first cellular atlas of the conductive arteries in hindlimb-unloaded rats, revealing a spectrum of dysregulated gene profiles. The identification of the subclusters of ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts, cellular communication analysis and transcription factors prediction are also included in this work. The findings provide a reference for future research on vascular deconditioning following long-duration spaceflight.

        "Conclusion": "Comprehensive single-cell compendium of the vascular remodeling process in rats at the molecular level under simulated microgravity is described in our study. The identification of region-specific and artery-specific transcriptomic changes, along with commonalities between the CA and FA, contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the vascular remodeling process under microgravity conditions. By focusing on the less-explored fibroblasts and immune cells, as well as the sub-clusters within the major arterial cell types, our research sheds light on the intricate biological processes at play under simulated microgravity.",

        "Overview": "This study provides the first single-cell atlas of vascular remodeling in response to simulated microgravity, offering a high-resolution view of how arteries adapt to unloading. Using the rat hindlimb unloading model, researchers identified diverse cell populations and uncovered specific changes in gene expression and cell proportions, particularly in endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts. The findings highlight the plasticity of fibroblasts and the importance of cell-cell communication in the remodeling process, providing a valuable reference for understanding vascular deconditioning during long-duration spaceflight.",
        "Summary": "Background: Prolonged spaceflight causes vascular deconditioning and remodeling, but a detailed cellular and molecular map of these changes is lacking. This study aimed to create such a map by using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze the carotid and femoral arteries of rats subjected to hindlimb unloading, a model for simulated microgravity.\n\nMethods: Rats were subjected to 3 months of hindlimb unloading (HU). The carotid and femoral arteries were then dissected, and scRNA-seq was used to perform clustering analysis and identify different cell populations and their gene expression profiles. The researchers analyzed cell-cell communication networks and transcription factor (TF) activity to understand the regulatory mechanisms.\n\nResults: The analysis identified endothelial cells (ECs), smooth muscle cells (SMCs), fibroblasts, and various immune cells. HU caused an increase in the percentage of ECs in the carotid artery and a decrease in the proportion of SMCs in both arteries. Fibroblasts showed the most significant changes in gene expression. Sub-clustering revealed specialized cell subsets involved in processes like endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT). Enhanced intercellular interactions, especially between SMCs and fibroblasts, were observed, and several key transcription factors were identified as potentially driving the remodeling process.\n\nConclusions: This study presents the first cellular atlas of conductive arteries in hindlimb-unloaded rats, revealing a spectrum of dysregulated gene profiles at the single-cell level.

        "Abstract": "The hindlimb unloading (HU) model has been used extensively to simulate the cephalad fluid shift and musculoskeletal disuse observed in spaceflight with its application expanding to study immune, cardiovascular and central nervous system responses, among others. Most HU studies are performed with singly housed animals, although social isolation also can substantially impact behavior and physiology, and therefore may confound HU experimental results. Other HU variants that allow for paired housing have been developed although no systematic assessment has been made to understand the effects of social isolation on HU outcomes. Hence, we aimed to determine the contribution of social isolation to tissue responses to HU. To accomplish this, we developed a refinement to the traditional NASA Ames single housing HU system to accommodate social housing in pairs, retaining desirable features of the original design. We conducted a 30-day HU experiment with adult, female mice that were either singly or socially housed. HU animals in both single and social housing displayed expected musculoskeletal deficits versus housing matched, normally loaded (NL) controls. However, select immune and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responses were differentially impacted by the HU social environment relative to matched NL controls. HU led to a reduction in % CD4+ T cells in singly housed, but not in socially housed mice. Unexpectedly, HU increased adrenal gland mass in socially housed but not singly housed mice, while social isolation increased adrenal gland mass in NL controls. HU also led to elevated plasma corticosterone levels at day 30 in both singly and socially housed mice. Thus, musculoskeletal responses to simulated weightlessness are similar regardless of social environment with a few differences in adrenal and immune responses. Our findings show that combined stressors can mask, not only exacerbate, select responses to HU. These findings further expand the utility of the HU model for studying possible combined effects of spaceflight stressors.",

        "Abstract": "The mechanisms triggering disuse muscle atrophy remain of debate. It is becoming evident that mitochondrial dysfunction may regulate pathways controlling muscle mass. We have recently shown that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a major role in disuse atrophy of soleus, a slow, oxidative muscle. Here we tested the hypothesis that hindlimb unloading-induced atrophy could be due to mitochondrial dysfunction in fast muscles too, notwithstanding their much lower mitochondrial content. Gastrocnemius displayed atrophy following both 3 and 7 days of unloading. SOD1 and catalase up-regulation, no H2O2 accumulation and no increase of protein carbonylation suggest the antioxidant defence system efficiently reacted to redox imbalance in the early phases of disuse. A defective mitochondrial fusion (Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1 down-regulation) occurred together with an impairment of OXPHOS capacity. Furthermore, at 3 days of unloading higher acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) phosphorylation was found, suggesting AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway activation. To test the role of mitochondrial alterations we used Tg-mice overexpressing PGC-1\u03b1 because of the known effect of PGC-1\u03b1 on stimulation of Mfn2 expression. PGC-\u03b1 overexpression was sufficient to prevent (i) the decrease of pro-fusion proteins (Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1), (ii) activation of the AMPK pathway, (iii) the inducible expression of MuRF1 and atrogin1 and of authopagic factors, and (iv) any muscle mass loss in response to disuse. As the effects of increased PGC-1\u03b1 activity were sustained throughout disuse, compounds inducing PGC-1\u03b1 expression could be useful to treat and prevent muscle atrophy also in fast muscles.",

        "Overview": "This study provides compelling evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction is a key trigger for muscle atrophy in fast-twitch muscles during disuse, expanding on previous findings in slow-twitch muscles. Researchers showed that hindlimb unloading led to impaired mitochondrial fusion and energy production in the gastrocnemius muscle. Crucially, they demonstrated that overexpressing PGC-1\u03b1, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, was sufficient to prevent these mitochondrial defects, block the activation of atrophy pathways, and completely prevent muscle mass loss, identifying a potent therapeutic target.",
        "Summary": "Background: The mechanisms that trigger disuse muscle atrophy are still debated, but mitochondrial dysfunction is emerging as a key regulator. While this has been shown in slow, oxidative muscles, this study tested the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction also drives atrophy in fast-twitch muscles, which have a lower mitochondrial content.\n\nMethods: The researchers subjected mice to 3 and 7 days of hindlimb unloading and analyzed the gastrocnemius muscle. They measured markers of oxidative stress, mitochondrial fusion proteins (Mfn1, Mfn2, OPA1), oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity, and the activation of signaling pathways like AMPK. To test the role of mitochondria, they used transgenic mice that overexpress PGC-1\u03b1, which is known to stimulate the expression of Mfn2.\n\nResults: The gastrocnemius muscle showed atrophy after 3 and 7 days of unloading. This was accompanied by a defective mitochondrial fusion process (downregulation of Mfn1, Mfn2, and OPA1) and an impairment of OXPHOS capacity. The AMPK pathway also appeared to be activated. Remarkably, the overexpression of PGC-1\u03b1 was sufficient to prevent all of these effects: it prevented the decrease in pro-fusion proteins, blocked AMPK activation, prevented the induction of atrophy-related genes (MuRF1, atrogin1), and completely prevented any loss of muscle mass.\n\nConclusions: The study suggests that mitochondrial alterations, particularly related to fusion dynamics, are a key early event in the atrophy of fast-twitch muscles during disuse. The finding that PGC-1\u03b1 overexpression can prevent this atrophy suggests that compounds that induce PGC-1\u03b1 could be useful for treating and preventing muscle wasting."

Although not in complete solitude, astronauts operate in an isolated environment during spaceflight. In this study, we determined the effects of isolation and simulated microgravity solely or combined, on the inflammatory cytokine milieu of the hippocampus. Adult female wild-type mice underwent simulated microgravity by hindlimb unloading for 30 days in single or social (paired) housing. In hippocampus, simulated microgravity and isolation each regulate a discrete repertoire of cytokines associated with inflammation. Their combined effects are not additive. A model for mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) quenching via targeted overexpression of the human catalase gene to the mitochondria (MCAT mice), are protected from isolation- and/or simulated microgravity-induced changes in cytokine expression.

        "Overview": "This study provides a crucial insight into the neuroinflammatory effects of spaceflight stressors by demonstrating a key role for mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Researchers found that simulated microgravity and isolation each regulate a distinct set of inflammatory cytokines in the mouse hippocampus, but their combined effects are not simply additive. Importantly, a mouse model that quenches mitochondrial ROS was protected from these changes, suggesting that mitochondrial ROS signaling is a central mechanism in the brain's inflammatory response to spaceflight-like conditions.",
        "Summary": "Background: Isolation and microgravity are two stressors experienced during spaceflight that can alter physiology, including in the central nervous system. This study aimed to determine the effects of isolation and simulated microgravity, both alone and in combination, on the inflammatory cytokine environment of the hippocampus.\n\nMethods: Adult female wild-type mice were subjected to simulated microgravity via hindlimb unloading for 30 days, while being housed either singly (isolation) or in pairs (social). The same experiment was repeated with MCAT mice, a model for quenching mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) via the targeted overexpression of human catalase to the mitochondria. The expression of inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus was measured.\n\nResults: In wild-type mice, both simulated microgravity and isolation were found to regulate a discrete repertoire of inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus, and their combined effects were not additive. In the MCAT mice, which have reduced mitochondrial ROS signaling, the animals were protected from the isolation- and/or simulated microgravity-induced changes in cytokine expression.\n\nConclusions: The findings suggest a key role for mitochondrial ROS signaling in the neuroinflammatory responses to both simulated microgravity and prolonged isolation. This implicates mitochondrial ROS as an important mechanism in the brain's response to spaceflight-like stressors."

        "Abstract": "N6-threonylcarbamoyl-adenosine (t6A) is one of the few RNA modifications that is universally present in life. This modification occurs at high frequency at position 37 of most tRNAs that decode ANN codons, and stabilizes cognate anticodon\u2013codon interactions. Nearly all genetic studies of the t6A pathway have focused on single-celled organisms. In this study, we report the isolation of an extensive allelic series in the Drosophila ortholog of the core t6A biosynthesis factor Kae1. kae1 hemizygous larvae exhibit decreases in t6A that correlate with allele strength; however, we still detect substantial t6A-modified tRNAs even during the extended larval phase of null alleles. Nevertheless, complementation of Drosophila Kae1 and other t6A factors in corresponding yeast null mutants demonstrates that these metazoan genes execute t6A synthesis. Turning to the biological consequences of t6A loss, we characterize prominent kae1 melanotic masses and show that they are associated with lymph gland overgrowth and ectopic generation of lamellocytes. On the other hand, kae1 mutants exhibit other phenotypes that reflect insufficient tissue growth. Interestingly, whole-tissue and clonal analyses show that strongly mitotic tissues such as imaginal discs are exquisitely sensitive to loss of kae1, whereas nonproliferating tissues are less affected. Indeed, despite overt requirements of t6A for growth of many tissues, certain strong kae1 alleles achieve and sustain enlarged body size during their extended larval phase. Our studies highlight tissue-specific requirements of the t6A pathway in a metazoan context and provide insights into the diverse biological roles of this fundamental RNA modification during animal development and disease.",

They measured the levels of t6A-modified tRNAs in larvae with different alleles. They characterized the developmental and tissue-specific phenotypes of the kae1 mutants, including the formation of melanotic masses and the growth of various tissues like imaginal discs.\n\nResults: The kae1 mutant larvae showed a decrease in t6A levels that correlated with the severity of the allele. The mutants exhibited prominent melanotic masses associated with lymph gland overgrowth. In contrast, other tissues, particularly highly proliferative ones like imaginal discs, were exquisitely sensitive to the loss of kae1 and showed insufficient growth. Interestingly, some strong kae1 alleles were able to achieve an enlarged body size during their extended larval phase, despite the growth defects in specific tissues.\n\nConclusions: The study highlights the diverse and tissue-specific requirements of the t6A pathway in a multicellular animal. It reveals that loss of this fundamental RNA modification can lead to both over-proliferation and under-proliferation depending on the tissue context, providing new insights into its roles in development and disease."

        "Abstract": "SUMMARY The evolutionary success of parasitoid wasps, a highly diverse group of insects widely used in biocontrol, depends on a variety of life history strategies in conflict with those of their hosts [1]. Drosophila melanogaster is a natural host of parasitic wasps of the genus Leptopilina. Attack by L. boulardi (Lb), a specialist wasp to flies of the melanogaster group, activates NF-\u03baB-mediated humoral and cellular immunity. Inflammatory blood cells mobilize and encapsulate Lb eggs and embryos [2\u20135]. L. heterotoma (Lh), a generalist wasp, kills larval blood cells and actively suppresses immune responses. Spiked virus-like particles (VLPs) in wasp venom have clearly been linked to its successful parasitism of Drosophila [6], but VLP composition and their biotic nature have remained mysterious. Our proteomics studies reveal that VLPs lack viral coat proteins but possess a pharmacopoeia of (a) eukaryotic vesicular transport system, (b) immunity, and (c) previously unknown proteins. These novel proteins distinguish Lh from Lb VLPs; notably, some proteins specific to Lh VLPs possess sequence similarities with bacterial secretion system proteins. Structure-informed analyses of an abundant Lh VLP surface/spike-tip protein, p40, reveal similarities to the needle-tip invasin proteins SipD/IpaD of Gram negative bacterial type 3 secretion systems that breach immune barriers and deliver virulence factors into mammalian cells. Our studies suggest that Lh VLPs represent a new class of extracellular organelles and share pathways for protein delivery with both eukaryotic microvesicles and bacterial surface secretion systems. Given their mixed prokaryotic/eukaryotic properties, we propose the term Mixed Strategy Extracellular Vesicles (MSEVs) to replace VLP.",

Here we use systematic and comprehensive bioinformatics approaches to identify most of the mammalian eicosanoid synthesis enzymes.

During oviposition, female wasps introduce venom into the larval hosts\u2019 body cavity. The venom contains discrete, 300 nm-wide, mixed-strategy extracellular vesicles (MSEVs), until recently referred to as virus-like particles. While the crucial immune suppressive functions of L. heterotoma MSEVs have remained undisputed, their biotic nature and origin still remain controversial. In recent proteomics analyses of L. heterotoma MSEVs, we identified 161 proteins in three classes: conserved eukaryotic proteins, infection and immunity related proteins, and proteins without clear annotation. Here we report 246 additional proteins from the L. heterotoma MSEV proteome. An enrichment analysis of the entire proteome supports vesicular nature of these structures. Sequences for more than 90% of these proteins are present in the whole-body transcriptome. Sequencing and de novo assembly of the 460 Mb-sized L. heterotoma genome revealed 90% of MSEV proteins have coding regions within the genomic scaffolds. Altogether, these results explain the stable association of MSEVs with their wasps, and like other wasp structures, their vertical inheritance. While our results do not rule out a viral origin of MSEVs, they suggest that a similar strategy for co-opting cellular machinery for immune suppression may be shared by other wasps to gain advantage over their hosts.

Additionally, there is growing evidence that suggests that not only is the immune system being altered, but the pathogens that infect the host are significantly influenced by spaceflight and ground-based spaceflight conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that Serratia marcescens (strain Db11) was significantly more lethal to Drosophila melanogaster after growth on the International Space Station than ground-based controls, but the increased virulence phenotype of S. marcescens did not persist after the bacterial cultures were passaged on the ground. Increased virulence was also observed in bacteria that were grown in simulated microgravity conditions on the ground using the rotating wall vessel. Increased virulence of the space-flown bacteria was similar in magnitude between wild-type flies and those that were mutants for the well-characterized immune pathways Imd and Toll, suggesting that changes to the host immune system after infection are likely not a major factor contributing towards increased susceptibility of ground-reared flies infected with space-flown bacteria. Characterization of the bacteria shows that at later timepoints spaceflight bacteria grew at a greater rate than ground controls in vitro, and in the host. These results suggest complex physiological changes occurring in pathogenic bacteria in space environments, and there may be novel mechanisms mediating these physiological effects that need to be characterized.",

The virulence of these bacteria was then tested by infecting D. melanogaster. The study used both wild-type flies and mutants with defective immune pathways (Imd and Toll) to assess whether host immunity was a factor. The growth rate of the bacteria was also characterized both in vitro and inside the host.\n\nResults: S. marcescens grown on the ISS was significantly more lethal to the flies than ground-based controls, and a similar increase in virulence was seen with bacteria grown in the RWV. This increased virulence phenotype was not persistent after the bacteria were passaged back on the ground. The effect was similar in both wild-type and immune-deficient flies, suggesting that changes in the host's immune response were not the primary cause. Instead, the space-flown bacteria were found to grow at a greater rate both in vitro and in the host.\n\nConclusions: The study suggests that complex physiological changes occur in pathogenic bacteria in space environments. The increased virulence of S. marcescens appears to be due to changes in the bacterium itself, leading to faster growth, rather than a compromised host immune system.

        "Abstract": "The wasps Leptopilina heterotoma parasitize and ingest their Drosophila hosts. They produce extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the venom that are packed with proteins, some of which perform immune suppressive functions. EV interactions with blood cells of host larvae are linked to hematopoietic depletion, immune suppression, and parasite success. But how EVs disperse within the host, enter and kill hematopoietic cells is not well understood. Using an antibody marker for L. heterotoma EVs, we show that these parasite-derived structures are readily distributed within the hosts\u2019 hemolymphatic system. EVs converge around the tightly clustered cells of the posterior signaling center (PSC) of the larval lymph gland, a small hematopoietic organ in Drosophila. The PSC serves as a source of developmental signals in na\u00efve animals. In wasp-infected animals, the PSC directs the differentiation of lymph gland progenitors into lamellocytes. These lamellocytes are needed to encapsulate the wasp egg and block parasite development. We found that L. heterotoma infection disassembles the PSC and PSC cells disperse into the disintegrating lymph gland lobes. Genetically manipulated PSC-less lymph glands remain non-responsive and largely intact in the face of L. heterotoma infection. We also show that the larval lymph gland progenitors use the endocytic machinery to internalize EVs. Once inside, L. heterotoma EVs damage the Rab7- and LAMP-positive late endocytic and phagolysosomal compartments. Rab5 maintains hematopoietic and immune quiescence as Rab5 knockdown results in hematopoietic over-proliferation and ectopic lamellocyte differentiation. Thus, both aspects of anti-parasite immunity, i.e., (a) phagocytosis of the wasp\u2019s immune-suppressive EVs, and (b) progenitor differentiation for wasp egg encapsulation reside in the lymph gland. These results help explain why the lymph gland is specifically and precisely targeted for destruction. The parasite\u2019s simultaneous and multipronged approach to block cellular immunity not only eliminates blood cells, but also tactically blocks the genetic programming needed for supplementary hematopoietic differentiation necessary for host success. In addition to its known functions in hematopoiesis, our results highlight a previously unrecognized phagocytic role of the lymph gland in cellular immunity. EV-mediated virulence strategies described for L. heterotoma are likely to be shared by other parasitoid wasps; their understanding can improve the design and development of novel therapeutics and biopesticides as well as help protect biodiversity.",

They also investigated the mechanism of EV uptake and their effect on endocytic compartments within the lymph gland progenitors.\n\nResults: The study showed that the wasp EVs are distributed throughout the host and converge around the PSC of the lymph gland. The wasp infection was found to disassemble the PSC, and genetically removing the PSC made the lymph glands non-responsive and resistant to destruction. The lymph gland progenitors were shown to internalize the EVs via the endocytic machinery. Once inside, the EVs damaged the late endocytic and phagolysosomal compartments. The study also found that the endocytic protein Rab5 is required to maintain hematopoietic quiescence.\n\nConclusions: The study reveals a multi-pronged attack where the wasp not only kills existing blood cells but also tactically blocks the genetic programming needed for supplementary hematopoietic differentiation by targeting the PSC. The results highlight a previously unrecognized phagocytic role for the lymph gland in cellular immunity and explain why this organ is a specific target for the parasite."

        "Abstract": "As generalist parasitoid wasps, Leptopilina heterotoma are highly successful on many species of fruit flies of the genus Drosophila. The parasitoids produce specialized multi-strategy extracellular vesicle (EV)-like structures in their venom. Proteomic analysis identified several immunity-associated proteins, including the knottin peptide, LhKNOT, containing the structurally conserved inhibitor cysteine knot (ICK) fold, which is present in proteins from diverse taxa. Our structural and docking analysis of LhKNOT\u2019s 36-residue core knottin fold revealed that in addition to the knottin motif itself, it also possesses a Cation\u2013Polar\u2013Cation (CPC) clip. The CPC clip motif is thought to facilitate antimicrobial activity in heparin-binding proteins. Surprisingly, a majority of ICKs tested also possess the CPC clip motif, including 75 bona fide plant and arthropod knottin proteins that share high sequence and/or structural similarity with LhKNOT. Like LhKNOT and these other 75 knottin proteins, even the Drosophila Drosomycin antifungal peptide, a canonical target gene of the fly\u2019s Toll-NF-kappa B immune pathway, contains this CPC clip motif. Together, our results suggest a possible defensive function for the parasitoid LhKNOT. The prevalence of the CPC clip motif, intrinsic to the cysteine knot within the knottin proteins examined here, suggests that the resultant 3D topology is important for their biochemical functions. The CPC clip is likely a highly conserved structural motif found in many diverse proteins with reported heparin binding capacity, including amyloid proteins. Knottins are targets for therapeutic drug development, and insights into their structure\u2013function relationships will advance novel drug design.",

By revealing that this motif, known for antimicrobial activity, is prevalent in proteins from diverse taxa including the fly's own Drosomycin, the study suggests a potential defensive function for the venom peptide and provides new insights into the structure-function relationships of knottins, which are important targets for drug development.",
        "Summary": "Background: The parasitoid wasp Leptopilina heterotoma uses venom to suppress the immune system of its Drosophila host. Proteomic analysis of the venom identified a knottin peptide, LhKNOT, which contains a structurally conserved inhibitor cysteine knot (ICK) fold. The function of this peptide was unknown.\n\nMethods: The study used in silico structural and docking analysis to examine the 36-residue core knottin fold of LhKNOT. The researchers then searched for the identified structural motif in a database of other bona fide knottin proteins from plants and arthropods, as well as other proteins with the ICK fold.\n\nResults: The analysis revealed that in addition to the knottin motif, LhKNOT also possesses a Cation\u2013Polar\u2013Cation (CPC) clip, a motif thought to facilitate antimicrobial activity by binding to heparin-like molecules. A survey of other ICK proteins found that a majority, including 75 other knottins and the Drosophila antifungal peptide Drosomycin, also contain this CPC clip motif.\n\nConclusions: The prevalence of the CPC clip motif within the cysteine knot of LhKNOT and many other knottin proteins suggests that this 3D topology is important for their biochemical functions, including a potential defensive role for the parasitoid peptide. The CPC clip is likely a highly conserved structural motif important for the heparin-binding capacity of many diverse proteins and provides new insights for the design of therapeutic drugs based on knottin structures."

        "Abstract": "During space travel, humans are continuously exposed to two major environmental stresses, microgravity (\u03bcG) and space radiation. One of the fundamental questions is whether the two stressors are interactive. For over half a century, many studies were carried out in space, as well as using devices that simulated \u03bcG on the ground to investigate gravity effects on cells and organisms, and we have gained insights into how living organisms respond to \u03bcG. However, our knowledge on how to assess and manage human health risks in long-term mission to the Moon or Mars is drastically limited. For example, little information is available on how cells respond to simultaneous exposure to space radiation and \u03bcG. In this study, we analyzed the frequencies of chromosome aberrations (CA) in cultured human lymphoblastic TK6 cells exposed to X-ray or carbon ion under the simulated \u03bcG conditions. A higher frequency of both simple and complex types of CA were observed in cells exposed to radiation and \u03bcG simultaneously compared to CA frequency in cells exposed to radiation only. Our study shows that the dose response data on space radiation obtained at the 1G condition could lead to the underestimation of astronauts\u2019 potential risk for health deterioration, including cancer. This study also emphasizes the importance of obtaining data on the molecular and cellular responses to irradiation under \u03bcG conditions.",

Researchers found that exposing human lymphoblastic cells to radiation under simulated microgravity conditions resulted in a higher frequency of both simple and complex chromosome aberrations compared to radiation alone. This is a significant finding because it implies that risk models based on radiation exposure at 1G could be underestimating the potential health risks, including cancer, for astronauts on long-duration missions.",
        "Summary": "Background: During space travel, humans are simultaneously exposed to microgravity (\u00b5G) and space radiation, but it is unclear if these two stressors interact. While many studies have investigated the effects of \u00b5G, little is known about how cells respond to the combined exposure.\n\nMethods: Cultured human lymphoblastic TK6 cells were exposed to either X-rays or carbon ions under simulated microgravity conditions (using a 3D clinostat) or under normal 1G conditions. The researchers then analyzed the frequency of both simple and complex types of chromosome aberrations (CA) in the cells from the different conditions.\n\nResults: The study found a higher frequency of both simple and complex chromosome aberrations in cells that were exposed to radiation and simulated microgravity simultaneously, compared to the frequency in cells that were exposed to radiation only at 1G.\n\nConclusions: The study shows that dose-response data on space radiation obtained under standard 1G conditions could lead to an underestimation of the potential health risks, such as cancer, for astronauts. The findings emphasize the importance of obtaining more data on the molecular and cellular responses to irradiation under actual or simulated microgravity conditions."

Although typically grown as 1-2mm diameter colonies under certain conditions yeast can form very large (10 + mm in diameter) or \u2018giant\u2019 colonies on agar. Giant yeast colonies have been used to study diverse biomedical processes such as cell survival, aging, and the response to cancer pharmacogenomics. Such colonies evolve dynamically into complex stratified structures that respond differentially to environmental cues. Ammonia production, gravity driven ammonia convection, and shear defense responses are key differentiation signals for cell death and reactive oxygen system pathways in these colonies. The response to these signals can be modulated by experimental interventions such as agar composition, gene deletion and application of pharmaceuticals. In this study we used physical factors including colony rotation and microgravity to modify ammonia convection and shear stress as environmental cues and observed differences in the responses of both ammonia dependent and stress response dependent pathways We found that the effects of random positioning are distinct from rotation. Furthermore, both true and simulated microgravity exacerbated both cellular redox responses and apoptosis. These changes were largely shear-response dependent but each model had a unique response signature as measured by shear stress genes and the promoter set which regulates them These physical techniques permitted a graded manipulation of both convection and ammonia signaling and are primed to substantially contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of drug action, cell aging, and colony differentiation.",

The differentiation within these colonies is influenced by ammonia production and gravity-driven ammonia convection. This study used physical factors, including rotation and microgravity, to modify these environmental cues.\n\nMethods: Giant yeast colonies were exposed to different physical conditions, including colony rotation, a random positioning machine (simulated microgravity), and actual spaceflight (true microgravity). The researchers then observed the responses of ammonia-dependent and stress-response-dependent pathways, including cellular redox responses, apoptosis, and the expression of shear-stress genes.\n\nResults: The effects of random positioning were found to be distinct from those of simple rotation. Both true and simulated microgravity exacerbated cellular redox responses and apoptosis (cell death). These changes were found to be largely dependent on the shear-response pathway, although each model (true vs. simulated microgravity) had a unique response signature as measured by the expression of shear-stress genes.\n\nConclusions: The study demonstrates that physical techniques like clinorotation and microgravity can be used to manipulate convection and signaling within yeast colonies. This allows for a better understanding of the mechanisms of drug action, cell aging, and colony differentiation, showing that both true and simulated microgravity can increase cellular stress and apoptosis."

While the transcriptome of various tissues had been studied, the kidney's response was not yet characterized. This study aimed to compare the transcriptomes of the liver and kidney to identify any common pathways activated by spaceflight.\n\nMethods: The researchers performed a genome-wide gene array analysis on kidney and liver tissue from mice that were flown in space for 12 days. The gene expression profiles from the space-flown mice were then compared to those of ground-based control animals to identify differentially expressed genes and pathways in each tissue.\n\nResults: Although there were many tissue-specific changes in gene expression, the study found that both the liver and the kidney overexpressed genes that fell into the same four functional areas. These common areas were: (a) cellular responses to peptides, hormones, and nitrogen compounds; (b) apoptosis and cell death; (c) fat cell differentiation; and (d) negative regulation of protein kinase activity.\n\nConclusions: The study concludes that there are common gene expression pathways that are activated in multiple tissue types in response to spaceflight stimuli. The identification of these shared responses, particularly in areas like apoptosis and metabolism, provides a broader picture of the systemic effects of spaceflight on the body."

Clinical data on the appropriate use of liposomal-amphotericin B (liposomal-AmB) with cryptococcal meningitis are limited.

We also review the cases of CNS infection caused by C albidus and its related species. Patient concerns:A severely obese female patient was admitted to neurosurgical ward with lesions in the intracranial space and accompanying headache. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed prominent lesions in the right parietal and left frontal insular region. After glioma resection, C albidus was isolated from her cerebrospinal fluid samples. Diagnoses, interventions, and outcomes:She diagnosed histopathologically with a Cryptococcus species infection. The culture from her cerebrospinal fluid sample showed the growth of yeast-like colonies, which were identified as C albidus with mass spectrometry. She was treated with liposomal-AmB (50 mg day-1 intravenously) plus 5-fluorocytosine (10 g day-1 orally in 4 divided doses) for 6 weeks. The patient was asymptomatic at the time of discharge.

        "Summary": "Background: Central nervous system (CNS) infections caused by the yeast Cryptococcus albidus are rare but often have high mortality rates. Clinical data on the appropriate use of liposomal-amphotericin B (liposomal-AmB) for treating these infections, especially in severely obese patients, are limited.\n\nMethods: This is a case report. A severely obese female patient was diagnosed with C. albidus meningitis after glioma resection. She was treated with a combination of liposomal-AmB (50 mg/day intravenously) and 5-fluorocytosine for 6 weeks. The dose of liposomal-AmB was calculated based on the patient's ideal body weight, not her actual body weight.\n\nResults: After the 6-week treatment course, the patient was asymptomatic at the time of discharge, indicating a successful treatment outcome. The case demonstrates that using ideal body weight to calculate the liposomal-AmB dose was both efficacious and safe for this patient.\n\nConclusions: The paper's lesson is that using ideal body weight to calculate the dose of liposomal-AmB should be considered for severely obese patients with C. albidus meningitis. The report also includes a review of other cases of CNS infection caused by C. albidus and related species."

        "Abstract": "Increased viscosity of concentrated contrast media (CM) in the renal tubules can perturb renal hemodynamics and have a detrimental effect on tubular epithelial cells. However, the effects of viscosity on contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) remain poorly understood. Conventional in vitro culture studies do not reflect the rheological properties of CM. Therefore, we investigated the effects of CM viscosity on renal tubules using a kidney-on-a-chip and two different types of CM. Renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTEC) were cultured in a three-dimensional microfluidic culture platform under bidirectional fluid shear stress. We treated the RPTEC with two types of CM: low- (LOCM, iopromide) and iso-osmolar contrast media (IOCM, iodixanol). Renal tubular cell injury induced by LOCM and IOCM was examined under different iodine concentrations (50\u2013250 mgI/mL) and shear-stress conditions. LOCM showed a significant dose-dependent cytotoxic effect, which was significantly higher than that of IOCM under static and low-to-moderate shear stress conditions. However, high shear-stress resulted in reduced cell viability in IOCM; no difference between IOCM and LOCM was found under high shear-stress conditions. The cytotoxic effects were pronounced at a mean shear stress of 1 dyn/cm2 or higher. The high viscosity of IOCM slowed the fluid flow rate and augmented fluid shear-stress. We suggest an alternative in vitro model of CIN using the three-dimensional kidney-on-a-chip. Our results indicate a vital role of viscosity-induced nephrotoxicity under high shear-stress conditions, contrary to the findings of conventional in vitro studies.",

ObjectiveComparison of the effect of subcutaneous injection of different concentrations of epinephrine/physiological saline into EAC under general anesthesia in otoendoscopic surgery on surgical field clarity and hemodynamics. DesignThis double-blind, RCT study was about the effect of topical epinephrine injection in otoendoscopic surgery. SettingThis study was conducted at a single institution. ParticipantsThis study included 168 patients conformed to the inclusion criteria. InterventionPatients were randomized to receive different concentrations of epinephrine/physiological saline injection (1:5000, 1:10,000, 1:20,000, or 1:40,000) into the junction of bone and cartilage at posterior wall of EAC during surgery. Main Outcome MeasuresSurgical field clarity was assessed with surgical field clarity grading scale and tympanic membrane flap flipping time. Hemodynamic changes were monitored by clinical parameters of blood pressure, heart rate, and ST segment of ECG. ResultsThere were no statistically-significant differences in surgical field clarity grade (P = .577) and tympanic membrane flap flipping time (P = .490) among 4 concentration groups. Epinephrine injection did cause an increase in hemodynamic parameters when compared with baseline (P < .05). Compared with the relatively-lower concentration groups (1:20,000 and 1:40,000), the relatively-higher concentration groups (1:5000 and 1:10,000) had more significant and long-lasting effect until 30 minutes after injection.

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND CONTEXT:Prolonged microgravity exposure is associated with localized low back pain and an elevated risk of post-flight disc herniation. Although the mechanisms by which microgravity impairs the spine are unclear, they should be foundational for developing in-flight countermeasures for maintaining astronaut spine health. Because human spine anatomy has adapted to upright posture on Earth, observations of how spaceflight affects the spine should also provide new and potentially important information on spine biomechanics that benefit the general population. PURPOSE:This study compares quantitative measures of lumbar spine anatomy, health, and bio-mechanics in astronauts before and after 6 months of microgravity exposure on board the International Space Station (ISS). STUDY DESIGN:This is a prospective longitudinal study. SAMPLE:Six astronaut crewmember volunteers from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) with 6-month missions aboard the ISS comprised our study sample. OUTCOME MEASURES:For multifidus and erector spinae at L3\u2013L4, measures include cross-sectional area (CSA), functional cross-sectional area (FCSA), and FCSA/CSA. Other measures include supine lumbar lordosis (L1\u2013S1), active (standing) and passive (lying) flexion-extension range of motion (FE ROM) for each lumbar disc segment, disc water content from T2-weighted intensity, Pfirrmann grade, vertebral end plate pathology, and subject-reported incidence of chronic low back pain or disc injuries at 1-year follow-up. METHODS:3T magnetic resonance imaging and dynamic fluoroscopy of the lumbar spine were collected for each subject at two time points: approximately 30 days before launch (pre-flight) and 1 day following 6 months spaceflight on the ISS (post-flight). Outcome measures were compared between time points using paired t tests and regression analyses. RESULTS:Supine lumbar lordosis decreased (flattened) by an average of 11% (p=.019). Active FE ROM decreased for the middle three lumbar discs (L2\u2013L3: \u221222.1%, p=.049; L3\u2013L4: \u221217.3%, p=.016; L4\u2013L5: \u221230.3%, p=.004). By contrast, no significant passive FE ROM changes in these discs were observed (p>.05). Disc water content did not differ systematically from pre- to post-flight. Multifidus and erector spinae changed variably between subjects, with five of six subjects experiencing an average decrease 20% for FCSA and 8%\u20139% for CSA in both muscles. For all subjects, changes in multifidus FCSA strongly correlated with changes in lordosis (r2=0.86, p=.008) and active FE ROM at L4\u2013L5 (r2=0.94, p=.007). Additionally, changes in multifidus FCSA/CSA correlated with changes in lordosis (r2=0.69, p=.03). Although multifidus-associated changes in lordosis and ROM were present among all subjects, only those with severe, pre-flight end plate irregularities (two of six subjects) had post-flight lumbar symptoms (including chronic low back pain or disc herniation). CONCLUSIONS:We observed that multifidus atrophy, rather than intervertebral disc swelling, associated strongly with lumbar flattening and increased stiffness. Because these changes have been previously linked with detrimental spine biomechanics and pain in terrestrial populations, when combined with evidence of pre-flight vertebral end plate insufficiency, they may elevate injury risk for astronauts upon return to gravity loading. Our results also have implications for deconditioned spines on Earth. We anticipate that our results will inform new astronaut countermeasures that target the multifidus muscles, and research on the role of muscular stability in relation to chronic low back pain and disc injury. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc.

        "Overview": "This study provides a crucial link between post-flight back pain, increased disc herniation risk, and specific muscular changes in astronauts. Using MRI and dynamic fluoroscopy, researchers found that 6 months in space leads to atrophy of the multifidus muscle, which strongly correlates with a flattening of the lumbar spine and increased stiffness during active motion. This is a must-read for space medicine and spine biomechanics experts, as it shifts the focus from simple disc swelling to muscular deconditioning as a primary driver of post-flight spinal issues.",
        "Summary": "Background: Prolonged microgravity exposure is associated with low back pain in astronauts and an elevated risk of post-flight disc herniation. The underlying mechanisms are unclear but are foundational for developing effective countermeasures.\n\nMethods: Six astronauts were studied before and after their 6-month missions on the ISS. The researchers used 3T MRI to measure the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the multifidus and erector spinae muscles, supine lumbar lordosis, and disc water content. Dynamic fluoroscopy was used to measure active (standing) and passive (lying) flexion-extension range of motion (FE ROM) for each lumbar disc segment.\n\nResults: Post-flight, astronauts showed a significant decrease (flattening) in supine lumbar lordosis and a significant decrease in active FE ROM in the middle lumbar discs. In contrast, passive FE ROM and disc water content did not change systematically. Five of six subjects experienced an average 20% decrease in multifidus functional CSA. This multifidus atrophy was strongly correlated with the changes in lordosis and active ROM. Post-flight symptoms (chronic pain, disc herniation) only occurred in the two subjects who had severe, pre-existing vertebral end plate irregularities.\n\nConclusions: The study observed that multifidus atrophy, rather than intervertebral disc swelling, was strongly associated with lumbar flattening and increased spinal stiffness after spaceflight. These changes, especially when combined with pre-existing end plate damage, may elevate the risk of injury for astronauts upon their return to gravity. The results will inform new astronaut countermeasures that target the multifidus muscles."

        "Abstract": "Bone remodeling may occur in spaceflight as a response to skeletal unloading and head-ward fluid shifts. While unloading causes significant loss of bone mass and density in legs of animals exposed to microgravity, increased blood and interstitial fluid flows accompanying microgravity-induced fluid redistribution may elicit an opposite effect in the head. Seven C57BL/6 mice were randomly chosen for exposure to 15 days of microgravity on the STS-131 mission, while eight littermates served as ground controls. Upon mission completion, all 15 mice calvariae were imaged on a micro-computed tomography scanner. A standardized rectangular volume was placed on the parietal bones of each calvaria for analyses, and three parameters were determined to measure increased parietal bone volume: bone volume (BV), cross-sectional thickness (CsTh), and tissue mineral density (TMD). Microgravity exposure caused a statistically significant increase in BV of the space flight (SF) group compared to the ground control (GC) group \u2013 the mean \u00b1 SD for SF group was 10.48 \u00b1 0.47 %, compared to 9.64 \u00b1 0.79 % for GC group (p<0.05). CsTh demonstrated a trend of increase from 0.099 \u00b10.006 mm in the GC group to 0.104 \u00b10.005 mm in the SF group (p=0.12). TMD was similar between the two groups with 0.878 \u00b10.029 g/cc for GC and 0.893 \u00b1 0.028 g/cc for SF (p=0.31). Our results indicate that microgravity causes adaptive changes in calvarial bones that do not normally bear weight. These findings suggest that fluid shifts alone accompanying microgravity may initiate bone remodeling independent of skeletal loading by tissue.",

        "Overview": "This study provides compelling evidence that the head-ward fluid shifts experienced in space can initiate bone remodeling independent of mechanical loading. By examining the calvaria (skulls) of mice after a 15-day space mission, researchers found a statistically significant increase in parietal bone volume compared to ground controls. This is a significant finding because the calvaria are not weight-bearing bones, suggesting that the altered fluid dynamics of microgravity alone are sufficient to trigger an adaptive, bone-growing response in the head.",
        "Summary": "Background: Bone remodeling in spaceflight is thought to be a response to both skeletal unloading (causing bone loss) and head-ward fluid shifts. While unloading effects are well-documented, the effect of fluid shifts on non-load-bearing bones in the head is less clear. This study aimed to investigate this effect on the calvaria of mice.\n\nMethods: Seven mice were exposed to 15 days of microgravity on the STS-131 space shuttle mission, while eight littermates served as ground controls. After the mission, the calvariae of all mice were imaged using a micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) scanner. A standardized volume of the parietal bones was analyzed to measure bone volume (BV), cross-sectional thickness (CsTh), and tissue mineral density (TMD).\n\nResults: The spaceflight (SF) group showed a statistically significant increase in bone volume of the parietal bones compared to the ground control (GC) group (10.48% vs. 9.64%). There was also a trend of increased cross-sectional thickness in the SF group. Tissue mineral density was similar between the two groups.\n\nConclusions: The results indicate that microgravity causes adaptive changes in calvarial bones, which do not normally bear weight. The findings suggest that the fluid shifts that accompany microgravity can initiate bone remodeling independently of changes in skeletal loading."

ObjectiveThe purpose of this study is to analyze the lumbar spine\u2019s response to backpack loads with upright MRI in ILBP children in order to compare their results to previously published normal child data under the same conditions. We hypothesize that typical backpack loads will have a different effect on the lumbar spine of normal and ILBP children. Summary of Background DataResearch in normal children shows that backpack loads compress the lumbar IVDs, increase lumbar coronal deformity, and increase pain. MethodsFifteen pediatric and adolescent patients with ILBP were selected. Patients were excluded if a spinal deformity, an underlying pathology, or known injury was identified. A 0.6T upright MRI scanner imaged the subjects while supine and standing wearing 0 kg, 4 kg, and 8 kg backpacks. IVD height, lumbar lordosis, lumbar coronal deformity, and pain score were recorded after each condition and compared using ANOVAs. We compared the above variables between ILBP and normal subjects using generalized least squares models. ResultsThe cohort\u2019s mean age was 13 \u00b1 3 years. The 4 kg and 8 kg backpacks only compressed the L5-S1 IVD relative to upright with no load. Subjects experienced increasing pain with increasing load. Load had no effect on lumbar lordosis or lumbar coronal deformity. Compared to normal children, ILBP children experience significantly less disc compression at T12-L1 to L4-5, less lumbar lordosis, and more pain with increasing load. ConclusionsIn ILBP children, increasing backpack load compresses only the L5-S1 IVD. Compared to normal children, ILBP children experience less lumbar IVD compression, less lumbar lordosis, and more pain due to increasing load suggesting altered mechanisms for load tolerance in ILBP children.",

        "Overview": "This study uses upright MRI to reveal how children with idiopathic low back pain (ILBP) respond differently to backpack loads compared to healthy children. The key finding is that ILBP children experience significantly less disc compression in their upper lumbar spine, have less lumbar lordosis, and report more pain with increasing loads.

        "Summary": "Background: Previous research in normal children has shown that backpack loads compress the lumbar intervertebral discs (IVDs). This study aimed to analyze the lumbar spine's response to backpack loads in children with idiopathic low back pain (ILBP) to see if it differed from the normal response.\n\nMethods: Fifteen pediatric and adolescent patients with ILBP, but no identifiable spinal pathology, were studied. A 0.6T upright MRI scanner was used to image the subjects in four conditions: supine, standing with no backpack, and standing with 4 kg and 8 kg backpacks. IVD height, lumbar lordosis, lumbar coronal deformity, and pain scores were recorded and compared across conditions and to previously published data from normal children.\n\nResults: In the ILBP children, only the L5-S1 IVD was significantly compressed by the backpack loads relative to standing with no load. As expected, they experienced increasing pain with increasing load. When compared to normal children, the ILBP children showed significantly less disc compression at the T12-L1 to L4-5 levels, had less lumbar lordosis, and reported more pain with increasing backpack load.\n\nConclusions: The study concludes that children with ILBP have a different spinal response to backpack loading than healthy children. The reduced disc compression and lordosis, coupled with increased pain, suggest that they have altered mechanisms for load tolerance in their lumbar spine."

While bending motions are main contributors to herniation, the effects of microgravity on the bending properties of spinal discs are unknown. Consequently, the goal of this study was to quantify the bending properties of tail discs from mice with or without microgravity exposure. Caudal motion segments from six mice returned from a 30-day Bion M1 mission and eight vivarium controls were loaded to failure in four-point bending. After testing, specimens were processed using histology to determine the location of failure, and adjacent motion segments were scanned with micro-computed tomography (\u03bcCT) to quantify bone properties. We observed that spaceflight significantly shortened the nonlinear toe region of the force-displacement curve by 32% and reduced the bending strength by 17%. Flight mouse spinal segments tended to fail within the growth plate and epiphyseal bone, while controls tended to fail at the disc-vertebra junction. Spaceflight significantly reduced vertebral bone volume fraction, bone mineral density, and trabecular thickness, which may explain the tendency of flight specimens to fail within the epiphyseal bone. Together, these results indicate that vertebral bone loss during spaceflight may degrade spine bending properties and contribute to increased disc herniation risk in astronauts.",

By testing the bending properties of mouse tail spinal segments after a 30-day space mission, researchers found that spaceflight not only reduced bending strength but also altered the failure mode, causing fractures within the weakened vertebral bone rather than at the disc-vertebra junction. This finding suggests that vertebral bone degradation is a key factor that compromises spine integrity and increases injury risk after spaceflight.",
        "Summary": "Background: The rate of intervertebral disc herniation is significantly increased in astronauts after spaceflight, and bending motions are a major contributor to herniation. However, the effects of microgravity on the bending properties of spinal discs were unknown.\n\nMethods: The researchers took caudal (tail) motion segments from six mice that had returned from the 30-day Bion-M1 space mission and from eight vivarium controls. These segments were loaded to failure in a four-point bending test. After testing, histology was used to determine where the failure occurred. Adjacent motion segments were scanned with micro-computed tomography (\u00b5CT) to quantify vertebral bone properties.\n\nResults: Spaceflight significantly reduced the bending strength of the spinal segments by 17%. It also shortened the nonlinear 'toe region' of the force-displacement curve, indicating a change in the initial compliance of the tissue. Importantly, the failure mode was altered: spaceflight specimens tended to fail within the vertebral growth plate and epiphyseal bone, whereas control specimens tended to fail at the junction between the disc and the vertebra. This was consistent with \u00b5CT findings that showed spaceflight significantly reduced vertebral bone volume fraction, bone mineral density, and trabecular thickness.\n\nConclusions: The results indicate that vertebral bone loss during spaceflight degrades the bending properties of the spine. This degradation, along with the shift in failure location to the weakened bone, may contribute to the increased risk of disc herniation in astronauts."

        "Abstract": "Astronauts suffer from a loss of bone mass at a rate of 1.5% per month from lower regions of the body during the course of long-duration (>30 days) spaceflight, a phenomenon that poses important risks for returning crew. Conversely, a gain in bone mass may occur in non-load bearing regions of the body as related to microgravity-induced cephalad fluid shift. Representing non-load bearing regions with mouse calvaria and leveraging the STS-131 (15-day) and BION-M1 (30-day) flights, we examined spatial and temporal calvarial vascular remodeling and gene expression related to microgravity exposure compared between spaceflight (SF) and ground control (GC) cohorts. We examined parasagittal capillary numbers and structures in calvaria from 16 to 23 week-old C57BL/6 female mice (GC, n = 4; SF, n = 5) from STS-131 and 19\u201320 week-old C57BL/6 male mice (GC, n = 6; SF, n = 6) from BION-M1 using a robust isolectin-IB4 vessel marker. We found that the vessel diameter reduces significantly in mice exposed to 15 days of spaceflight relative to control. Capillarization increases by 30% (SF vs. GC, p = 0.054) in SF mice compared to GC mice. The vessel numbers and diameter remain unchanged in BION-M1 mice calvarial section. We next analyzed the parietal pro-angiogenic (VEGFA) and pro-osteogenic gene (BMP-2, DMP1, RUNX2 and OCN) expression in BION-M1 mice using quantitative RT-PCR. VEGFA gene expression increased 15-fold while BMP-2 gene expression increased 11-fold in flight mice compared to GC. The linkage between vascular morphology and gene expression in the SF conditions suggests that angiogenesis may be important in the regulation of pathological bone growth in non-weight bearing regions of the body. Short-duration microgravity-mediated bone restructuring has implications in planning effective countermeasures for long-duration flights and extraterrestrial human habitation.",
        "Conclusion": "This work describes microgravity-associated alterations in pro-angiogenic and pro-osteogenic gene expression in an unloaded bone region in two wild-type study populations. These results suggest skull vasculature and bone as a sensor for gravity and cephalad fluid shifts, outcomes that highlight the importance of the development of countermeasures for long-duration spaceflight. An in-depth, gender-based study of mouse calvaria that includes genomic, proteomic and metabolomic components will further characterize pathways involved in the increase in calvaria growth seen in study populations exposed to microgravity. Future study will also examine the behavior of BMP-2 gene expression levels post-flight, and whether these levels return to baseline prior to euthanasia. These results also suggest that key molecules associated with angiogenesis (VEGFA) and osteogenesis (BMP-2) genes are modulated in BION-M1 mice calvaria exposed to 30 days of microgravity. We suggest that VEGFA and BMP-2 genes are gravity sensors in mouse calvaria. The finding is relevant in the development of countermeasures for prolonged crewed spaceflight and to understand the molecular and structural adaptations of bone and vasculature to the microgravity environment. Lastly, there is a need to monitor the entire astronaut skeletal system on a meta-scale and in a spatio-temporal manner; this type of inquiry will leverage the site-specific, heterogenic skeletal responses and the sufficiency of short-term microgravity exposure to induce upregulation of angiogenic and osteogenic gene expression.",

By examining mouse calvaria (skulls) after short- and long-duration spaceflights, researchers found that short-term flight was associated with increased capillarization, while long-term flight showed a dramatic 11- to 15-fold increase in the expression of pro-osteogenic (BMP-2) and pro-angiogenic (VEGFA) genes. This suggests that the cephalad fluid shift in microgravity triggers an active angiogenic and osteogenic response in the skull, a key finding for understanding skeletal adaptation and planning long-duration missions.",

Parasagittal capillary numbers, diameter, and structures were examined using an isolectin-IB4 vessel marker. The expression of pro-angiogenic (VEGFA) and pro-osteogenic (BMP-2, DMP1, etc.) genes was analyzed in the parietal bone from the BION-M1 mice using quantitative RT-PCR.\n\nResults: After 15 days of spaceflight, vessel diameter was significantly reduced, while capillarization (vessel density) showed a trend of increasing by 30%. After 30 days of flight, vessel numbers and diameter were unchanged compared to controls, but there was a massive 15-fold increase in VEGFA gene expression and an 11-fold increase in BMP-2 gene expression in the flight mice.\n\nConclusions: The study suggests that angiogenesis may be important in the regulation of pathological bone growth in non-weight bearing regions during spaceflight. The upregulation of VEGFA and BMP-2 in the 30-day flight mice indicates that these genes are modulated by microgravity and may be acting as gravity sensors in the mouse calvaria.

M. marinum were grown in high aspect ratio vessels (HARVs) using a rotary cell culture system subjected to LSMMG or the control orientation (normal gravity, NG) and the cultures used to determine bacterial growth, bacterium size, transcriptome changes, and resistance to stress. Two exposure times to LSMMG and NG were examined: bacteria were grown for ~40 h (short), or 4 days followed by re-dilution and growth for ~35 h (long). M. marinum exposed to LSMMG transitioned from exponential phase earlier than the NG culture. They were more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide but showed no change in resistance to gamma radiation or pH 3.5. RNA-Seq detected significantly altered transcript levels for 562 and 328 genes under LSMMG after short and long exposure times, respectively. Results suggest that LSMMG induced a reduction in translation, a downregulation of metabolism, an increase in lipid degradation, and increased chaperone and mycobactin expression. Sigma factor H (sigH) was the only sigma factor transcript induced by LSMMG after both short and long exposure times.

Researchers found that Mycobacterium marinum grown under low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) showed significant changes in its transcriptome, suggesting a shift toward a state resembling that found during infection of a host macrophage.

The researchers compared bacterial growth, cell size, resistance to various stresses (hydrogen peroxide, gamma radiation, acid), and global gene expression (transcriptome) using RNA-Seq.\n\nResults: M. marinum exposed to LSMMG transitioned out of exponential growth earlier than the NG cultures. They also became more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that 562 genes were differentially expressed after short exposure and 328 after long exposure. The overall transcriptional profile suggested a reduction in translation and metabolism, an increase in lipid degradation, and an increase in the expression of chaperones and mycobactin (an iron-scavenging molecule). The sigma factor H (sigH) was the only sigma factor whose transcript was induced by LSMMG at both time points.\n\nConclusions: The transcriptome studies suggest that LSMMG may simulate a nutrient-deprived environment for M. marinum, similar to what the bacterium might experience inside a host macrophage during an infection. The study also implicates the sigma factor sigH as a key player in the M. marinum response to simulated microgravity."

The resulting root growth and curvature were analyzed using image sequences.\n\nResults: Horizontal clinorotation did not affect the root growth rate, but vertical clinorotation reduced it slightly. The effect on curvature was more dramatic and depended on the orientation. With vertical clinorotation, the maximal curvature decreased as the rotation speed increased.

        "Abstract": "The significant horticultural crop, cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis) is vulnerable to the excessive salt concentration in the soil, which contributes to its scaled-down growth and productivity, among other indices. The current study examines the efficacy of hydropriming, halopriming, and osmopriming on the physio-biochemical attributes and tolerance to salinity (100 mM NaCl) in cauliflower under controlled conditions. The results showed that the salinity (100 mM NaCl) has significant deleterious impacts on cauliflower seed germination, seedling growth, and photosynthetic attributes, and provoked the production of reactive oxygen species. In contrast, different priming approaches proved beneficial in mitigating the negative effects of salinity and boosted the germination, vigor indices, seedling growth, and physio-biochemical attributes like photosynthetic pigments, protein, and proline content while suppressing oxidative damage and MDA content in cauliflower seedlings in treatment- and dose-dependent manner. PCA revealed 61% (PC1) and 15% (PC2) of the total variance with substantial positive relationships and high loading conditions on all germination attributes on PC1 with greater PC1 scores for PEG treatments showing the increased germination indices in PEG-treated seeds among all the priming treatments tested. All 13 distinct priming treatments tried clustered into three groups as per Ward's approach of systematic categorization, clustering the third group showing relatively poor germination performances. Most germination traits exhibited statistically significant associations at the p < 0.01 level. Overall, the results established the usefulness of the different priming approaches facilitating better germination, survival, and resistance against salinity in the cauliflower to be used further before sowing in the salt-affected agro-ecosystems.",
        "Conclusion": "5  The results of the present study showed that different sustainable eco-friendly, cost-effective, and user-friendly seed priming strategies, such as hydro-, halo-, and osmo-priming, proved beneficial for improved germination indices and other morphophysiological traits under the regime of salt stress in Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis. The results were essentially related to proline accumulation in prepared cauliflower seedlings, which lowered MDA levels and alleviated lipid peroxidation (membrane damage) with increased total soluble protein and photosynthetic pigments on seedlings treated with 100 mM NaCl. The present results imply that various priming agents such as water, NaCl, PEG, proline, and thiourea proved effective to accelerate the germination rate, synchronized growth, and metabolite activation under the high NaCl level. In summary, simple and affordable priming treatments such as hydro-, halo-, and osmo-priming can be used to improve the performance of cauliflower crops. However, additional research on the beneficial effect of priming approaches will support the scalability of sustainable production and increased crop outputs, boosted crop quality and quantity, establishment, and reduction of salt damage in order to meet food demand, particularly on agricultural land under a variety of favorable and stressful conditions, as this is a priority of modern agricultural research. The information gained would also support molecular breeding research to develop cauliflower varieties that are more resistant to salt stress. Understanding the processes that promote salt stress tolerance can aid in the development of strategies to achieve sustainable crop yields under these adverse conditions.",

        "Overview": "This study is highly relevant for agriculture in saline environments, as it demonstrates the effectiveness of various seed priming techniques in mitigating the negative effects of salt stress on cauliflower. The research shows that hydropriming, halopriming, and osmopriming can all boost germination, enhance seedling growth, and improve key physio-biochemical attributes while suppressing oxidative damage. This provides a practical, eco-friendly, and cost-effective strategy for improving crop performance and resistance in salt-affected agro-ecosystems.",
        "Summary": "Background: The horticultural crop cauliflower is vulnerable to high salt concentrations in the soil, which reduce its growth and productivity. This study aimed to examine the efficacy of different seed priming techniques (hydro-, halo-, and osmopriming) in improving the tolerance of cauliflower to salinity.\n\nMethods: Cauliflower seeds were subjected to various priming treatments (e.g., with water, NaCl, PEG, proline, thiourea) and then tested for their performance under saline conditions (100 mM NaCl). The researchers measured germination attributes, seedling growth, photosynthetic pigments, protein and proline content, and markers of oxidative damage (MDA content).\n\nResults: Salinity had significant deleterious effects on all measured parameters in unprimed seeds. In contrast, the different priming approaches proved beneficial, boosting germination, vigor, seedling growth, and the levels of photosynthetic pigments, protein, and proline. The priming treatments also suppressed oxidative damage. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that PEG treatments were particularly effective at increasing germination indices.\n\nConclusions: The study concludes that simple and affordable priming treatments can be used to improve the performance of cauliflower crops under salt stress. The results suggest that these treatments work by promoting the accumulation of proline, which helps to lower oxidative damage. This information can be used to develop strategies for sustainable crop production on salt-affected land."

        "Abstract": "Although heat and desiccation stresses often coincide, the response to heat especially in desiccation tolerant plants is rarely studied. We subjected hydrated Pleopeltis polypodioides fronds to temperatures up to 50\u00b0C and dehydrated fronds up to 65\u00b0C for 24 h. The effect of heat stress was evaluated using morphological changes, photosystem (PS) II efficiency, and metabolic indicators. Pinnae of dried fronds exposed to more than 40\u00b0C curled tighter and became brittle compared to fronds dried at lower temperatures. Exposure to > 50\u00b0C leads to discolored fronds after rehydration. Hydrated fronds turned partially brown at > 35\u00b0C. Chlorophyll fluorescence (Ft) and quantum yield (Qy) increased following re-hydration but the recovery process after 40\u00b0C treatment lasted longer than at lower temperatures. Similarly, hydrated fronds showed reduced Qy when exposed to > 40\u00b0C. Dried and hydrated fronds remained metabolically active up to 40\u00b0C. Hydroperoxides and lipid hydroperoxides in dried samples remained high up to 50\u00b0C, but decreased in hydrated fronds at > 40\u00b0C. Catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH) oxidizing activities remained high up to 40\u00b0C in dehydrated fronds and up to 35\u00b0C in hydrated fronds. Major fatty acids detected in both dehydrated and hydrated fronds included palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acids, oleic (18:1), linoleic (C18:2); and linolenic (C18:3) acids. Linolenic acid was most abundant. In dried fronds, all fatty acids decreased at > 35\u00b0C. The combined data indicate that the thermotolerance of dry fronds is about 55\u00b0C but is at least 10\u00b0C lower for hydrated fronds.",
        "Conclusion": "The mechanism of Pleopeltis response to heat stress is complex. Our biochemical data indicate that > 40\u00b0C causes heat stress in Pleopeltis fronds. Despite obvious stress signals, dried fronds recovered after exposure up to 55\u00b0C while thermo-tolerance of hydrated fronds was limited to 40\u00b0C. The difference in heat tolerance between hydrated and dried fronds indicates that dehydration protects Pleopeltis from heat damage. Our data further illustrate the adaptability of this epiphytic fern to cope with environmental stress.",

Researchers found that while hydrated fronds suffer damage above 35-40\u00b0C, dried fronds can tolerate temperatures up to 55\u00b0C before showing signs of irreversible damage. This is an important finding for understanding the survival strategies of extremophilic plants, as it demonstrates how desiccation mitigates heat damage by allowing the plant to maintain its metabolic and antioxidative machinery at much higher temperatures.",
        "Summary": "Background: Heat and desiccation stresses often occur together, but the response of desiccation-tolerant plants to heat is not well studied. This research aimed to determine the thermotolerance of the resurrection fern, Pleopeltis polypodioides, in both its hydrated and desiccated states.\n\nMethods: Hydrated fern fronds were subjected to temperatures up to 50\u00b0C for 24 hours, while dehydrated fronds were subjected to temperatures up to 65\u00b0C. The researchers evaluated the effect of the heat stress using several metrics: morphological changes, photosystem II efficiency (chlorophyll fluorescence), metabolic indicators, markers of oxidative stress (hydroperoxides), antioxidant enzyme activities, and fatty acid composition.\n\nResults: Dried fronds could recover after exposure to temperatures up to 55\u00b0C, while the thermotolerance of hydrated fronds was limited to about 40\u00b0C. Above 35\u00b0C, hydrated fronds turned partially brown and showed reduced quantum yield. In contrast, dried fronds remained metabolically active up to 40\u00b0C, and their antioxidative enzymes remained active at higher temperatures than in the hydrated fronds. In dried fronds, major fatty acids decreased at temperatures above 35\u00b0C.\n\nConclusions: The study concludes that the thermotolerance of dry Pleopeltis fronds is about 55\u00b0C, which is at least 10\u00b0C higher than that of hydrated fronds. This difference indicates that the state of dehydration actively protects the fern from heat damage, allowing it to better cope with environmental stress."

        "Abstract": "Unlike typical negative gravitropic curvature, young hypocotyls of Brassica rapa and other dicots exhibit positive gravitropism. This positive curvature occurs at the base of the hypocotyl and is followed by the typical negative gravity-induced curvature. We investigated the role of auxin in both positive and negative hypocotyl curvature by examining the transcription of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 in curving tissue. We compared tissue extraction of the convex and concave flank with Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE). Based on Ubiquitin1 (UBQ1) as a reference gene, the log (2) fold change of all examined genes was determined. Transcription of the examined genes varied during the graviresponse suggesting that these genes affect differential elongation. The transcription of all genes was upregulated in the lower flank and downregulated in the upper flank during the initial downward curving period. After 48 h, the transcription profile reversed, suggesting that the ensuing negative gravicurvature is controlled by the same genes as the positive gravicurvature. High-spatial resolution profiling using SPGE revealed that the transcription profile of the examined genes was spatially distinct within the curving tissue. The comparison of the hypocotyl transcription profile with the root tip indicated that the tip tissue is a suitable reference for curving hypocotyls and that root and hypocotyl curvature are controlled by the same physiological processes.",

Using a high-spatial-resolution gene extraction technique, the researchers show that genes like PIN1 and PIN3 are upregulated in the lower flank during the initial downward curve, and then this profile reverses as the hypocotyl transitions to normal negative gravitropism. This is a significant finding as it suggests that the same set of genes controls both the initial positive and subsequent negative curvature, just in a temporally regulated manner.",
        "Summary": "Background: Unlike the typical upward growth of shoots, the young hypocotyls of some dicots, like Brassica rapa, exhibit an initial positive gravitropism (downward curvature). This is then followed by the expected negative gravitropism. This study aimed to investigate the role of auxin in this process by examining the transcription of key auxin-related genes.\n\nMethods: The researchers used Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE), a technique that allows for high-spatial resolution tissue sampling, to extract RNA from the convex and concave flanks of the curving hypocotyl tissue. They then used qPCR to measure the transcription levels of four auxin-related genes: PIN1, PIN3, IAA5, and ARG1. These profiles were examined at different time points during the gravitropic response.\n\nResults: The transcription of the examined genes was found to vary spatially and temporally during the graviresponse. During the initial downward curving period, the transcription of all four genes was upregulated in the lower flank and downregulated in the upper flank. After 48 hours, as the hypocotyl began to curve upwards, this transcription profile reversed. The high-resolution profiling with SPGE revealed that the transcription was spatially distinct within the curving tissue.\n\nConclusions: The study suggests that the same set of auxin-related genes affects the differential elongation that drives both the initial positive and the subsequent negative gravicurvature of the hypocotyl. The reversal of the transcription profile over time indicates that these genes are dynamically regulated to control the direction of the curvature."

Both gravi- and phototropism determine directional growth and previous experiments showed that high gradient magnetic fields (HGMF) can induce curvature in roots and shoots. Experiments with Brassica rapa verified that that gravitropism-like induction of curvature is possible in space and that the HGMF-responsive organelles are amyloplasts. We assessed the effect of space and HGMF based on 16 genes and compared their transcription with static growth and clinorotation. Amyloplasts size in root tips increased under weightlessness but decreased under clinorotation but not in response to magnetic fields. Amyloplast size changes were correlated with reduced amylase transcription in space samples and enhanced transcription after clinorotation. Mechanostimulation and weightlessness have opposite effects on the size of amyloplasts. The data show that plants perceive weightlessness, and that their metabolism adjusts to microgravity and mechanostimulation.

The cell membrane participates in numerous processes, including endo- and exocytosis and cell division, and is involved in the response to external stimuli. Variable but stabilized microdomains form in membranes that include specific lipids and proteins that became known as (detergent-resistant) membrane microdomains, or lipid rafts with various subclassifications. The composition, especially the sterol-dependent recruitment of specific proteins affects endo- and exo-membrane domains as well as plasmodesmata. The enhanced saturated fatty acid content in lipid rafts after clinorotation suggests increased rigidity and reduced membrane permeability as a primary response to abiotic and mechanical stress. These results can also be obtained with lipid-sensitive stains. The linkage of the CM to the cytoskeleton via rafts is part of the complex interactions between lipid microdomains, mechanosensitive ion channels, and the organization of the cytoskeleton. These intricately linked structures and functions provide multiple future research directions to elucidate the role of lipid rafts in physiological processes.",

        "Abstract": "Like many other organisms, plants are capable of sensing and responding to mechanical stimuli such as touch, osmotic pressure, and gravity. One mechanism for the perception of force is the activation of mechanosensitive (or stretch-activated) ion channels, and a number of mechanosensitive channel activities have been described in plant membranes. Based on their homology to the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscS, the 10 MscS-Like (MSL) proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana have been hypothesized to form mechanosensitive channels in plant cell and organelle membranes. However, definitive proof that MSLs form mechanosensitive channels has been lacking. Here we used single-channel patch clamp electrophysiology to show that MSL10 is capable of providing a MS channel activity when heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. This channel had a conductance of \u223c100 pS, consistent with the hypothesis that it underlies an activity previously observed in the plasma membrane of plant root cells. We found that MSL10 formed a channel with a moderate preference for anions, which was modulated by strongly positive and negative membrane potentials, and was reversibly inhibited by gadolinium, a known inhibitor of mechanosensitive channels. MSL10 demonstrated asymmetric activation/inactivation kinetics, with the channel closing at substantially lower tensions than channel opening.

Genetic or pharmacological ablation of S1PR3, or blockade of S1P production, significantly impaired the behavioral response to noxious mechanical stimuli, with no effect on responses to innocuous touch or thermal stimuli.

Recent advances, however, have illustrated the advantages of the oocyte system for studying plant and bacterial mechanosensitive channels. Here we describe in detail the methods used for heterologous expression and characterization of bacterial and plant mechanosensitive channels in Xenopus oocytes.",

By using an Arabidopsis mutant with constitutive plastid osmotic stress, researchers found that this internal organellar stress triggers the production of a callus-like mass at the shoot apex. They then dissected the molecular pathway, showing that this process requires cytokinin signaling, reactive oxygen species, and key retrograde signaling components (GUN1, ABI4), providing a detailed model for how plastid status is communicated to control stem cell fate.",
        "Summary": "Background: The balance between cell proliferation and differentiation in the plant shoot apical meristem is controlled by regulatory loops involving the hormone cytokinin and stem cell identity genes. This differentiation is also coordinated with the status of the plastids within the cells. This study investigated the pathways that connect plastid stress to cell differentiation at the shoot apex.\n\nMethods: The researchers used an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant (msl2 msl3) that has enlarged and deformed plastids, creating a state of constitutive plastid osmotic stress. They analyzed the phenotype of these mutants, which develop a callus mass at the shoot apex. They then investigated the molecular and genetic pathways required for this callus formation, including the roles of cytokinin receptors, cytokinin signaling inhibitors (ARR7, ARR15), the stem cell gene WUSCHEL, reactive oxygen species, ABA biosynthesis, and the retrograde signaling proteins GUN1 and ABI4.\n\nResults: Callus production in the msl2 msl3 mutant was found to require the cytokinin receptor AHK2. It was characterized by increased cytokinin levels, downregulation of cytokinin signaling inhibitors, and induction of the WUSCHEL gene. Furthermore, this plastid stress-induced callus formation was dependent on elevated plastidic reactive oxygen species, ABA biosynthesis, and the retrograde signaling components GUN1 and ABI4.\n\nConclusions: The results are consistent with a model where both the cytokinin/WUS pathway and a retrograde signaling pathway originating from the stressed plastids converge to control cell differentiation at the shoot apex. This study provides a molecular framework for how the cell integrates information about organellar status to regulate developmental decisions."

This anatomical change is remarkably congruent with recent reports of decreased utricular function in astronauts, suggesting a clear structural basis for the functional deficits.",
        "Summary": "Background: Spaceflight imposes a radically different sensory environment on the inner ear utricle, which normally senses gravity. This study aimed to investigate if this altered environment leads to synaptic modifications in the utricle.\n\nMethods: The researchers examined the utricles from mice that had flown on a space shuttle mission. They used immunofluorescence and microscopy to analyze synaptic structures within the sensory epithelium of the utricle. They specifically looked for changes in synapse density in different regions of the utricle.\n\nResults: The study detected structural synaptic plasticity in the form of a decreased synapse density. This change was specifically observed in the medial extrastriola region of the utricle, an area associated with encoding static head position with respect to gravity.\n\nConclusions: The observed decrease in synapse density in a key region of the utricle provides a structural correlate for the functional deficits in utricular function that have been reported in astronauts immediately after returning from the International Space Station. This suggests that the vestibular system undergoes synaptic remodeling in response to the absence of gravity."

Background:Ground-based microgravity simulation can reproduce the apparent effects of weightlessness in spaceflight using clinostats that continuously reorient the gravity vector on a specimen, creating a time-averaged nullification of gravity. In this work, we investigated the effects of clinorotation speed on the morphology, cytoarchitecture, and migration behavior of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Methods:We compared cell responses at clinorotation speeds of 0, 30, 60, and 75 rpm over 8 h in a recently developed lab-on-chip-based clinostat system. Time-lapse light microscopy was used to visualize changes in cell morphology during and after cessation of clinorotation. Cytoarchitecture was assessed by actin and vinculin staining, and chemotaxis was examined using time-lapse light microscopy of cells in NGF (100 ng/ml) gradients. Results:Among clinorotated groups, cell area distributions indicated a greater inhibition of cell spreading with higher angular frequency (P<0.005), though average cell area at 30 rpm after 8 h became statistically similar to control (P=0.794). Cells at 75 rpm clinorotation remained viable and were able to re-spread after clinorotation. In chemotaxis chambers, clinorotation did not alter migration patterns in elongated cells, but most clinorotated cells exhibited cell retraction, which strongly compromised motility. Conclusions:These results indicate that hMSCs respond to clinorotation by adopting more rounded, less-spread morphologies. The angular frequency-dependence suggests that a cell\u2019s ability to sense the changing gravity vector is governed by the rate of perturbation.

Using a novel lab-on-a-chip clinostat, the researchers found that clinorotation inhibits cell spreading in a speed-dependent manner, causing cells to adopt more rounded morphologies. This is an important finding for space biology and tissue engineering, as it demonstrates that a cell's ability to sense the changing gravity vector is rate-dependent and that this altered physical state can compromise key cellular functions like motility.",
        "Summary": "Background: Ground-based microgravity simulation using clinostats is a common way to study the effects of weightlessness. This study aimed to determine the short-term effects of simulated microgravity, as a function of the clinorotation speed, on the morphology, cytoarchitecture, and migration of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs).\n\nMethods: The researchers used a lab-on-a-chip-based clinostat system to culture hMSCs at different clinorotation speeds (0, 30, 60, and 75 rpm) for 8 hours. Time-lapse microscopy was used to visualize changes in cell morphology during and after clinorotation. The cell's cytoarchitecture was assessed by staining for actin and vinculin. Chemotaxis (directed cell migration) was also examined using time-lapse microscopy.\n\nResults: Clinorotation caused the hMSCs to adopt more rounded, less-spread morphologies. This inhibition of cell spreading was greater at higher angular frequencies (speeds). Cells clinorotated at 75 rpm remained viable and were able to re-spread after the clinorotation was stopped. In chemotaxis chambers, clinorotation did not alter the migration patterns of cells that remained elongated, but most cells exhibited retraction and their motility was strongly compromised.\n\nConclusions: The results indicate that hMSCs respond to clinorotation by changing their shape. The speed-dependence of this response suggests that a cell\u2019s ability to sense the changing gravity vector is governed by the rate of the perturbation. The altered cell shape and retraction also strongly compromise the cells' ability to migrate."

        "Abstract": "IntroductionThe difficulty in re-growing and mineralizing new bone after severe fracture can result in loss of ambulation or limb. Here we describe the sequential roles of FGF-2 in inducing gene expression, cell growth and BMP-2 in gene expression and mineralization of bone. Materials and methodsThe regulation of gene expression was determined using real-time RTPCR (qRTPCR) and cell proliferation was measured by thymidine incorporation or fluorescent analysis of DNA content in MC3T3E1 osteoblast-like cells. Photomicroscopy was used to identify newly mineralized tissue and fluorescence was used to quantify mineralization. ResultsFibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) had the greatest ability to induce proliferation after 24 hours of treatment when compared to transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), bone morphogenic protein (BMP-2), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). We found that FGF-2 caused the most significant induction of expression of early growth response-1 (egr-1), fgf-2, cyclo-oxygenase-2 (cox-2), tgf\u03b2 and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (mmp-3) associated with proliferation and expression of angiogenic genes like vascular endothelial growth factor A (vegfA) and its receptor vegfr1. We found that FGF-2 significantly reduced gene expression associated with mineralization, e.g. collagen type-1 (col1a1), fibronectin (fn), osteocalcin (oc), IGF-1, noggin, bone morphogenic protein (bmp-2) and alkaline phosphatase (alp). In contrast, BMP-2 significantly stimulated expression of the mineralization associated genes but had little or no effect on gene expression associated with growth. ConclusionsThe ability of FGF-2 to re-program a mineralizing gene expression profile to one of proliferation suggests that FGF-2 plays a critical role of osteoblast growth in early fracture repair while BMP-2 is instrumental in stimulating mineralization.",
        "Conclusion": "These data demonstrate the de-differentiation (reduction of mineralization genes) effect of FGF-2 likely plays a key role in osteoblast proliferation, the first stage of bone formation. Some have expressed concern that ex-vivo proliferation of human stem cells by a growth factor like FGF-2 might change the osteogenic characteristics of a pre-osteoblast; however others have shown that expansion of the population does not affect later osteogenic potential [35] of stem cells. Therefore, an expansion of osteoblast cells by FGF-2 might be an excellent strategy for first stage re-population of a critical defect since FGF-2 has the needed efficacy for promoting proliferation. These data also suggest that the final stage of bone repair is best accomplished with BMP-2 due to its promotion of differentiation and mineralization.",

        "Overview": "This study clearly delineates the sequential and distinct roles of two key growth factors, FGF-2 and BMP-2, in the process of bone formation, with important implications for fracture repair. Researchers showed that FGF-2 acts as a powerful proliferative signal for osteoblast-like cells, inducing genes associated with cell growth and angiogenesis while simultaneously suppressing mineralization genes. In contrast, BMP-2 specifically stimulates the expression of mineralization-associated genes. This finding clarifies their complementary roles, suggesting that FGF-2 is critical for the initial cell expansion phase of bone repair, while BMP-2 is instrumental in the final mineralization stage.",
        "Summary": "Background: The difficulty in re-growing and mineralizing new bone after a severe fracture is a major clinical challenge. This study aimed to describe the sequential roles of Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and Bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2) in this process.\n\nMethods: The researchers used MC3T3E1 osteoblast-like cells. They measured cell proliferation in response to several growth factors, including FGF-2 and BMP-2. They used quantitative real-time RTPCR (qRTPCR) to measure the expression of genes associated with proliferation and mineralization in response to FGF-2 and BMP-2. Mineralization was quantified using fluorescence.\n\nResults: FGF-2 was found to have the greatest ability to induce proliferation after 24 hours. It caused a significant induction of genes associated with cell growth (e.g., egr-1, cox-2) and angiogenesis (e.g., vegfA). At the same time, FGF-2 significantly reduced the expression of genes associated with mineralization (e.g., col1a1, osteocalcin, alp). In stark contrast, BMP-2 had little effect on growth-related genes but significantly stimulated the expression of the mineralization-associated genes.\n\nConclusions: The study concludes that FGF-2 has a de-differentiating effect, re-programming the cells from a mineralizing state to a proliferative one. This suggests that FGF-2 plays a critical role in the early, cell-expansion stage of bone formation and fracture repair. Conversely, the final mineralization stage of bone repair is best accomplished with BMP-2, due to its specific promotion of differentiation and mineralization."

We examined the effects of lycopene and fish oil supplements versus placebo on the normal prostate microenvironment, among men pursuing active surveillance for low-burden prostate cancer. We hypothesized that lycopene or fish oil supplements would down-regulate insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) gene expression, respectively, reflecting putative proliferation (IGF-1) and inflammatory (COX-2) pathways relevant to carcinogenesis. MethodsWe conducted a 3-month randomized, double-blinded, clinical trial comparing prostate tissue gene expression profiles (assessed by qRT\u2013PCR) among men with favorable-risk prostate cancer receiving either 30 mg/day lycopene, 3 g/day fish oil (including 1,098 mg eicosapentaenoic and 549 mg docosahexaenoic fatty acids) or placebo.

        "Abstract": "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe lung disease in preterm infants, the abnormal proliferate and differentiate ability of type II epithelial cells (AEC II) is the key to the pathological basis of BPD. Mechanisms regarding abnormal AEC II in BPD remain unclear. The present work investigated the role and mechanisms of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells in lung disorder in BPD using public datasets, clinical samples, a hyperoxia-induced BPD mouse model and AEC II-iNKT cells transwell co-culture system. Firstly, we found that the NKT cells development factor IL-15 increased over time in patients with BPD in public databases, and clinically collected peripheral blood NKT cells in patients with BPD were increased. Subsequently, the percentage of iNKT cells increased in hyperoxia group compared with normoxia group, with the highest at P7, accompanied by increased activation with abnormal lung development. The administration of anti-CD1d neutralizing antibody to inhibit iNKT cells could alleviate the abnormal lung development of hyperoxia group mice, while \u03b1-GalCer administration could aggravate lung injury in hyperoxia group mice, and adoptive transfer of iNKT cells could aggravate the abnormal lung development in hyperoxia group mice. In addition, to further verify the role of iNKT cells on AEC II, AEC II-iNKT cells co-culture system was established. The presence of iNKT cells could aggravate the abnormal expression of SP-C and T1\u03b1 under hyperoxia. Meanwhile, RNA-seq analysis showed that ferroptosis-related genes were highly expressed in AEC II co-cultured with iNKT cells under hyperoxia. We further validated the effect of the presence of iNKT cells under hyperoxia environment on AEC II ferroptosis levels, suggested that iNKT cells promote AEC II ferroptosis under hyperoxia, accompanied by decreased expression of SP-C and T1\u03b1. Our study found that the recruitment of iNKT cells in the lung may be an important cause of alveolarization disorder in BPD.",

        "Overview": "This study is highly significant for neonatal medicine, as it identifies a novel mechanism contributing to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a severe lung disease in preterm infants. Researchers found that invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are increased in BPD and that these cells promote ferroptosis (a form of iron-dependent cell death) in alveolar type II (AEC II) epithelial cells, impairing their ability to proliferate and differentiate. This discovery links the immune system directly to AEC II dysfunction in BPD and identifies iNKT cells as a potential new therapeutic target.",
        "Summary": "Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a lung disease in preterm infants where the abnormal function of type II epithelial cells (AEC II) is a key pathological feature. The mechanisms behind this abnormality are unclear. This study investigated the role of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells in BPD.\n\nMethods: The study used a multi-pronged approach: analysis of public datasets and clinical samples from BPD patients, a hyperoxia-induced BPD mouse model, and an in vitro AEC II-iNKT cell transwell co-culture system. The researchers inhibited iNKT cells in the mouse model using an antibody and also adoptively transferred iNKT cells to confirm their role. RNA-seq analysis was used to identify pathways affected in the co-culture system.\n\nResults: The study found that NKT cell development factor IL-15 and the number of NKT cells were increased in BPD patients. In the mouse model, hyperoxia increased the percentage of activated iNKT cells in the lung, which was associated with abnormal lung development. Inhibiting iNKT cells alleviated the lung injury, while activating or transferring more iNKT cells aggravated it. The in vitro co-culture system showed that the presence of iNKT cells promoted ferroptosis in AEC II cells under hyperoxia, which was accompanied by a decrease in the expression of key AEC II differentiation markers.\n\nConclusions: The study found that the recruitment of iNKT cells into the lung may be an important cause of the alveolarization disorder seen in BPD. These immune cells appear to contribute to the disease by promoting the ferroptotic cell death of AEC II cells, thereby impairing lung development."

Researchers found that subjecting human endothelial cells to simulated gravitational unloading led to a significant decrease in the expression of adhesion molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines, while increasing the expression of eNOS and Caveolin-1. This anti-inflammatory and potentially anti-atherosclerotic phenotype was reversible with the reapplication of mechanical loading, highlighting the dynamic role of gravitational forces in maintaining vascular health.",
        "Summary": "Background: Mechanical forces, including gravity, are known to affect the function of endothelial cells (ECs) and have been implicated in both vascular disease and the changes associated with low-gravity environments. This study aimed to investigate the impact of gravitational mechanical unloading on the phenotype of ECs by analyzing their gene expression patterns.\n\nMethods: Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to either a standard 1-gravity environment or to mechanical unloading (MU) for 24 hours. Some cells also had periods of mechanical loading (ML) applied during the MU period. The researchers then measured the gene expression of several adhesion molecules, pro-inflammatory cytokines, eNOS, and Caveolin-1 and -2. They also observed changes in cell morphology.\n\nResults: Mechanical unloading led to a significant decrease in the gene expression of several adhesion molecules (like VCAM-1) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (like IL-6 and IL-8). Conversely, the expression of eNOS, Caveolin-1, and Caveolin-2 was significantly increased with MU. The cells also became smaller in length and width. Applying periods of mechanical loading during the unloading was sufficient to reverse these changes.\n\nConclusions: The results suggest that gravitational loading can dramatically affect vascular endothelial cell function. Mechanical unloading appears to induce an anti-inflammatory and potentially anti-atherosclerotic phenotype, which is reversed by the reintroduction of mechanical load."

        "Abstract": "Background:N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation has been associated with reduced mortality and inflammation in patients with cardiovascular disease. There are limited data on the effects of n-3 PUFA supplementation in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). Materials and methods:The OMEGA-PAD II trial was a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the effect of 3 mo of high-dose oral n-3 PUFA supplementation on inflammation, endothelial function, and walking ability in patients with PAD. Results:Twenty-four patients with claudication received 4.4 g/d of fish oil or placebo for 3 mo. Outcomes measured included high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, the omega-3 index, endothelial function as measured via flow-mediated vasodilation, walking impairment questionnaire, and a 6-min walk test. Plasma levels of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) were measured by liquid-chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In patients treated with fish oil, the absolute mean omega-3 index significantly increased from baseline (fish oil: 7.2 \u00b1 1.2%, P < 0.001; placebo: \u22120.4 \u00b1 0.9%, P = 0.31; between-group P < 0.001). Furthermore, there were significant increases in several pathway markers of SPM biosynthesis, including several mono-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acids and mono-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acids. We also observed significant increases in the SPM lipoxin A5 (fish oil: 0.57 \u00b1 0.70 pg/mL, P = 0.05; placebo: 0.01 \u00b1 0.38 pg/mL, P = 0.93; between-group P = 0.04) and resolvin E3 (fish oil: 154 \u00b1 171 pg/mL, P = 0.04; placebo: 32 \u00b1 54 pg/mL, P = 0.08; between-group P = 0.04). There were no significant changes in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, flow-mediated vasodilation, walking impairment questionnaire, or 6-min walk test in the fish oil group.

While the 3-month intervention did not result in significant clinical improvements in walking ability or inflammation markers, the study successfully demonstrated that fish oil supplementation significantly increases plasma levels of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) like lipoxin A5 and resolvin E3. This finding is important as it confirms a key biological effect of n-3 PUFAs and suggests that these anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving pathways are activated in PAD patients.",
        "Summary": "Background: Supplementation with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), like those in fish oil, has been associated with reduced mortality and inflammation in patients with cardiovascular disease. However, there is limited data on the effects of this supplementation in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD).\n\nMethods: The OMEGA-PAD II trial was a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Twenty-four patients with claudication (a symptom of PAD) received either 4.4 g/day of fish oil or a placebo for 3 months. The researchers measured outcomes including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), the omega-3 index, endothelial function, walking ability, and plasma levels of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs).\n\nResults: In the patients treated with fish oil, the omega-3 index significantly increased, confirming compliance and absorption. This was accompanied by significant increases in several pathway markers of SPM biosynthesis and in the levels of the SPMs lipoxin A5 and resolvin E3. However, there were no significant changes in hs-CRP, flow-mediated vasodilation, or the clinical measures of walking ability (walking impairment questionnaire and 6-min walk test) in the fish oil group.\n\nConclusions: The study concludes that fish oil supplementation increases the levels of SPMs in the plasma of patients with PAD. Although this did not translate to clinical improvements within the 3-month study period, the activation of these pro-resolving pathways is a significant biological effect. Further studies are required to determine if these early changes could lead to clinical improvements over a longer term."

By comparing global gene expression, researchers found that hepatocytes cultured as 3D aggregates in a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor upregulate a diverse array of liver-specific functional genes.

Instead, they represented a wide range of hepatocyte-specific functional genes. A significant over-representation of binding sites for the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4\u03b1 (Hnf4\u03b1) was found in the promoters of these upregulated genes.

        "Abstract": "Altered immune function has been demonstrated in astronauts during spaceflights dating back to Apollo and Skylab; this could be a major barrier to long-term space exploration. We tested the hypothesis that spaceflight causes changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression. Human leukocytes were stimulated with mitogens on board the International Space Station using an onboard normal gravity control. Bioinformatics showed that miR-21 was significantly up-regulated 2-fold during early T-cell activation in normal gravity, and gene expression was suppressed under microgravity. This was confirmed using quantitative real-time PCR (n = 4). This is the first report that spaceflight regulates miRNA expression. Global microarray analysis showed significant (P < 0.05) suppression of 85 genes under microgravity conditions compared to normal gravity samples. EGR3, FASLG, BTG2, SPRY2, and TAGAP are biologically confirmed targets and are co-up-regulated with miR-21. These genes share common promoter regions with pre-mir-21; as the miR-21 matures and accumulates, it most likely will inhibit translation of its target genes and limit the immune response. These data suggest that gravity regulates T-cell activation not only by transcription promotion but also by blocking translation via noncoding RNA mechanisms. Moreover, this study suggests that T-cell activation itself may induce a sequence of gene expressions that is self-limited by miR-21.\u2014Hughes-Fulford, M., Chang, T. T., Martinez, E. M., Li, C.-F.

This study tested the hypothesis that spaceflight causes changes in the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs), which are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression.\n\nMethods: Human leukocytes were stimulated with mitogens on board the International Space Station. The experiment included an onboard 1-gravity control (via a centrifuge) to distinguish the effects of microgravity from other spaceflight factors. The expression of miRNAs was analyzed, with a focus on miR-21, which was confirmed using quantitative real-time PCR. Global microarray analysis was also used to look at the expression of miR-21's target genes.\n\nResults: Bioinformatics and qRT-PCR confirmed that miR-21 was significantly upregulated during early T-cell activation in the normal gravity control, but this upregulation was suppressed under microgravity. A global microarray analysis showed that 85 genes were significantly suppressed under microgravity compared to the normal gravity samples. Several of these suppressed genes are known targets of miR-21.\n\nConclusions: This is the first report that spaceflight regulates miRNA expression. The data suggest that gravity regulates T-cell activation not only by promoting gene transcription but also by influencing non-coding RNA mechanisms that can block translation.

Here, I review more than thirty years of research from my laboratory, beginning with studies designed to test the theory that cells use tensegrity (tensional integrity) architecture to stabilize their shape and sense mechanical signals, which I believed to be critical for control of cell function and tissue development. Although I was trained as a cell biologist, I found that the tools I had at my disposal were insufficient to experimentally test these theories, and thus I ventured into engineering to find critical solutions. This path has been extremely fruitful as it has led to confirmation of the critical role that physical forces play in developmental control, as well as how cells sense and respond to mechanical signals at the molecular level through a process known as cellular mechanotransduction. Many of the predictions of the cellular tensegrity model relating to cell mechanical behaviors have been shown to be valid, and this vision of cell structure led to discovery of the central role that transmembrane adhesion receptors, such as integrins, and the cytoskeleton play in mechanosensing and mechanochemical conversion. In addition, these fundamental studies have led to significant unexpected technology fallout, including development of micromagnetic actuators for non-invasive control of cellular signaling, microfluidic systems as therapeutic extracorporeal devices for sepsis therapy, and new DNA-based nanobiotechnology approaches that permit construction of artificial tensegrities that mimic properties of living materials for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.",

        "Overview": "This article, based on the 2009 Pritzker Award Lecture, provides a fascinating, thirty-year retrospective on how the concept of tensegrity\u2014tensional integrity\u2014revolutionized our understanding of cellular mechanotransduction. Authored by a pioneer in the field, it traces the journey from a theoretical model of cell architecture to the discovery of the molecular mechanisms by which cells sense and respond to physical forces. It's a must-read for anyone in cell biology or bioengineering, as it not only validates the critical role of physical forces in developmental control but also showcases how fundamental research can lead to unexpected technological breakthroughs, from microfluidic therapies to DNA-based nanobiotechnology.",
        "Summary": "Background: This article is based on a lecture reviewing over thirty years of research from the author's laboratory. The research began with studies designed to test the theory that cells use tensegrity architecture to stabilize their shape and to sense the mechanical signals that are critical for controlling cell function and tissue development.\n\nMethods: The author recounts a research journey that started in cell biology but quickly ventured into engineering to find the tools necessary to test the tensegrity theory. The article discusses a wide range of experimental approaches, from cellular mechanics to molecular biology to the development of new technologies.\n\nResults: The research path described has been extremely fruitful. It has led to the confirmation of the critical role that physical forces play in developmental control and has helped to uncover how cells sense and respond to mechanical signals at the molecular level through mechanotransduction. Many of the predictions of the cellular tensegrity model have been shown to be valid. This vision also led to the discovery of the central role that transmembrane adhesion receptors like integrins and the cytoskeleton play in mechanosensing.\n\nConclusions: The fundamental studies on cellular tensegrity and mechanotransduction have led to significant and unexpected technology fallout. This includes the development of micromagnetic actuators for controlling cellular signaling, microfluidic systems for sepsis therapy, and new DNA-based nanobiotechnology approaches for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine."

        "Abstract": "The International Space Station (ISS) is a complex built environment physically isolated from Earth. Assessing the interplay between the microbial community of the ISS and its crew is important for preventing biomedical and structural complications for long term human spaceflight missions. In this study, we describe one crewmember\u2019s microbial profile from body swabs of mouth, nose, ear, skin and saliva that were collected at eight different time points pre-, during and post-flight. Additionally, environmental surface samples from eight different habitable locations in the ISS were collected from two flights. Environmental samples from one flight were collected by the crewmember and samples from the next flight were collected after the crewmember departed. The microbial composition in both environment and crewmember samples was measured using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and processed using the Livermore Metagenomics Analysis Toolkit. Ordination of sample to sample distances showed that of the eight crew body sites analyzed, skin, nostril, and ear samples are more similar in microbial composition to the ISS surfaces than mouth and saliva samples; and that the microbial composition of the crewmember\u2019s skin samples are more closely related to the ISS surface samples collected by the crewmember on the same flight than ISS surface samples collected by other crewmembers on different flights. In these collections, species alpha diversity in saliva samples appears to decrease during flight and rebound after returning to Earth. This is the first study to compare the ISS microbiome to a crewmember\u2019s microbiome via shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We observed that the microbiome of the surfaces inside the ISS resemble those of the crew\u2019s skin. These data support future crew and ISS microbial surveillance efforts and the design of preventive measures to maintain crew habitat onboard spacecraft destined for long term space travel.",

Bioaerosols were analyzed by metagenomic DNA sequencing and traditional culturing methods to characterize the composition and diversity of atmospheric samples compared to experimental controls. The relative abundance of taxa changed significantly at each altitude sampled, and the diversity profile shifted across the two sampling days, revealing a regional atmospheric microbiome that is dynamically changing.

        "Abstract": "BackgroundThe International Space Station (ISS) is a unique and complex built environment with the ISS surface microbiome originating from crew and cargo or from life support recirculation in an almost entirely closed system. The Microbial Tracking 1 (MT-1) project was the first ISS environmental surface study to report on the metagenome profiles without using whole-genome amplification. The study surveyed the microbial communities from eight surfaces over a 14-month period. The Microbial Tracking 2 (MT-2) project aimed to continue the work of MT-1, sampling an additional four flights from the same locations, over another 14 months. MethodsEight surfaces across the ISS were sampled with sterile wipes and processed upon return to Earth. DNA extracted from the processed samples (and controls) were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA) to detect intact/viable cells or left untreated and to detect the total DNA population (free DNA/compromised cells/intact cells/viable cells). DNA extracted from PMA-treated and untreated samples were analyzed using shotgun metagenomics. Samples were cultured for bacteria and fungi to supplement the above results. ResultsStaphylococcus sp. and Malassezia sp. were the most represented bacterial and fungal species, respectively, on the ISS. Overall, the ISS surface microbiome was dominated by organisms associated with the human skin. Multi-dimensional scaling and differential abundance analysis showed significant temporal changes in the microbial population but no spatial differences. The ISS antimicrobial resistance gene profiles were however more stable over time, with no differences over the 5-year span of the MT-1 and MT-2 studies. Twenty-nine antimicrobial resistance genes were detected across all samples, with macrolide/lincosamide/streptogramin resistance being the most widespread. Metagenomic assembled genomes were reconstructed from the dataset, resulting in 82 MAGs. Functional assessment of the collective MAGs showed a propensity for amino acid utilization over carbohydrate metabolism. Co-occurrence analyses showed strong associations between bacterial and fungal genera. Culture analysis showed the microbial load to be on average 3.0 \u00d7 105 cfu/m2 ConclusionsUtilizing various metagenomics analyses and culture methods, we provided a comprehensive analysis of the ISS surface microbiome, showing microbial burden, bacterial and fungal species prevalence, changes in the microbiome, and resistome over time and space, as well as the functional capabilities and microbial interactions of this unique built microbiome. Data from this study may help to inform policies for future space missions to ensure an ISS surface microbiome that promotes astronaut health and spacecraft integrity.

Graph convolutional networks, graph neural networks, random forest, and gradient boosting methods were trained using the embeddings, network features for predicting links and ranking top gene-disease associations for skeletal muscle atrophy. Drugs were selected and a disease drug knowledge graph was constructed. Link prediction methods were applied to the disease drug networks to identify top ranked drugs for therapeutic treatment of skeletal muscle atrophy. The graph convolution network performs best in link prediction based on receiver operating characteristic curves and prediction accuracies. The key genes involved in skeletal muscle atrophy are associated with metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases.

        "Abstract": "A single exposure to hindlimb unloading leads to changes in body mass, body composition and bone, but the consequences of multiple exposures are not yet understood. Within a 18wk period, adult C57BL/6 male mice were exposed to one (1x-HLU), two (2x-HLU) or three (3x-HLU) cycles of 2 wk of hindlimb unloading (HLU) followed by 4 wk of reambulation (RA), or served as ambulatory age-matched controls. In vivo \u00b5CT longitudinally tracked changes in abdominal adipose and lean tissues, lumbar vertebral apparent volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) and upper hindlimb muscle cross-sectional area before and after the final HLU and RA cycle. Significant decreases in total adipose tissue and vertebral vBMD were observed such that all unloaded animals reached similar values after the final unloading cycle. However, the magnitude of these losses diminished in mice undergoing their 2nd or 3rd HLU cycle. Irrespective of the number of HLU/RA cycles, total adipose tissue and vertebral vBMD recovered and were no different from age-matched controls after the final RA period. In contrast, upper hindlimb muscle cross-sectional area was significantly lower than controls in all unloaded groups after the final RA period. These results suggest that tissues in the abdominal region are more resilient to multiple bouts of unloading and more amenable to recovery during reambulation than the peripheral musculoskeletal system.",

        "Overview": "This study provides valuable insights into the resilience and adaptive capacity of the musculoskeletal and adipose tissues to repeated cycles of unloading and reloading. Researchers found that while mice lost adipose tissue and vertebral bone density during each hindlimb unloading (HLU) cycle, the magnitude of these losses diminished with repeated cycles. Importantly, these tissues fully recovered to control levels after reambulation, whereas peripheral hindlimb muscle did not. This is a crucial finding for understanding disuse osteoporosis, suggesting that tissues in the core of the body are more resilient than the peripheral musculoskeletal system.",
        "Summary": "Background: The consequences of a single exposure to disuse via hindlimb unloading (HLU) are well-known, but the effects of multiple exposures are not understood. This study aimed to investigate the impact of repeated cycles of unloading and reambulation on body composition and bone.\n\nMethods: Adult male mice were exposed to one, two, or three cycles of 2 weeks of HLU followed by 4 weeks of reambulation (RA). In vivo micro-CT was used to longitudinally track changes in abdominal adipose and lean tissues, lumbar vertebral bone mineral density (vBMD), and upper hindlimb muscle cross-sectional area. These were measured before and after the final HLU and RA cycles and compared to age-matched ambulatory controls.\n\nResults: All unloaded animals showed significant decreases in total adipose tissue and vertebral vBMD during the final unloading cycle. However, the magnitude of these losses was smaller in the mice undergoing their second or third HLU cycle, suggesting a blunted tissue sensitivity. After the final reambulation period, the total adipose tissue and vertebral vBMD recovered and were no different from the age-matched controls, regardless of the number of HLU cycles. In contrast, the upper hindlimb muscle cross-sectional area remained significantly lower than controls in all unloaded groups, even after reambulation.\n\nConclusions: The results suggest that tissues in the abdominal region (adipose tissue, lumbar vertebrae) are more resilient to multiple bouts of unloading and are more capable of recovery during reambulation than the peripheral musculoskeletal system (hindlimb muscle)."

        "Abstract": "Anthropologists frequently use the shaft bending strength index to infer the physical activity levels of humans living in the past from their lower limb bone remains. This index is typically calculated as the ratio of bone shaft second moments of area about orthogonal principal axes (i.e. Imax/Imin). Individuals with high Imax/Imin values are inferred to have been very active, whereas individuals with low values are inferred to have been more sedentary. However, there is little direct evidence that activity has a causal and predictable effect on the shaft bending strength index. Here, we report the results of two experiments that were designed to test the model within which anthropologists commonly interpret the shaft bending strength index. In the first experiment, mice were treated daily with treadmill exercise for 1 month to simulate a high-activity lifestyle. In the second experiment, in an attempt to simulate a low-activity lifestyle, functional weight-bearing was removed from the hindlimbs of mice for 1 month. Femoral mid-shaft structure was determined with \u03bcCT. We found that while exercise resulted in significant enhancement of Imax and Imin compared with controls, it failed to significantly increase the Imax/Imin index. Similarly, stunted bone growth caused by unloading resulted in significantly diminished Imax and Imin compared with controls, but low activity did not lead to significantly decreased Imax/Imin compared with normal activity. Together, these results suggest that caution is required when the bone shaft bending strength index is used to reconstruct the activity levels of past humans.",

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Force magnitudes have been suggested to drive the structural response of bone to exercise. As importantly, the degree to which any given bone can adapt to functional challenges may be enabled, or constrained, by regional variation in the capacity of marrow progenitors to differentiate into bone-forming cells. Here, we investigate the relationship between bone adaptation and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) responsivity in growing mice subject to exercise. First, using a force plate, we show that peak external forces generated by forelimbs during quadrupedal locomotion are significantly higher than hindlimb forces. Second, by subjecting mice to treadmill running and then measuring bone structure with \u03bcCT, we show that skeletal effects of exercise are site-specific but not defined by load magnitudes. Specifically, in the forelimb, where external forces generated by running were highest, exercise failed to augment diaphyseal structure in either the humerus or radius, nor did it affect humeral trabecular structure. In contrast, in the ulna, femur and tibia, exercise led to significant enhancements of diaphyseal bone areas and moments of area. Trabecular structure was also enhanced by running in the femur and tibia. Finally, using flow cytometry, we show that marrow-derived MSCs in the femur are more responsive to exercise-induced loads than humeral cells, such that running significantly lowered MSC populations only in the femur. Together, these data suggest that the ability of the progenitor population to differentiate toward osteoblastogenesis may correlate better with bone structural adaptation than peak external forces caused by exercise.",

        "Abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) responding to mechanical cues generated by physical activity is critical for skeletal development and remodeling. Here, we utilized low intensity vibrations (LIV) as a physiologically relevant mechanical signal and hypothesized that the confined cytoskeletal configuration imposed by 2D culture will enable human bone marrow MSCs (hBMSC) to respond more robustly when LIV is applied in-plane (horizontal-LIV) rather than out-of-plane (vertical-LIV). All LIV signals enhanced hBMSC proliferation, osteogenic differentiation, and upregulated genes associated with cytoskeletal structure. The cellular response was more pronounced at higher frequencies (100 Hz vs 30 Hz) and when applied in the horizontal plane. Horizontal but not vertical LIV realigned the cell cytoskeleton, culminating in increased cell stiffness. Our results show that applying very small oscillatory motions within the primary cell attachment plane, rather than perpendicular to it, amplifies the cell\u2019s response to LIV, ostensibly facilitating a more effective transfer of intracellular forces. Transcriptional and structural changes in particular with horizontal LIV, together with the strong frequency dependency of the signal, emphasize the importance of intracellular cytoskeletal configuration in sensing and responding to high-frequency mechanical signals at low intensities.",

Here, we applied 3wk of hindlimb unloading followed by 3wk of reambulation to a genetically heterogeneous population of 352 adult mice and tested the hypothesis that changes in muscle are associated with changes in bone at the level of the tissue and the genome. During unloading and relative to normally ambulating control mice, most mice lost muscle and cortical bone with large variability across the population. During reambulation, individual mice regained bone and muscle at different rates. Across mice, changes in muscle and trabecular/cortical bone were not correlated to each other during unloading or reambulation. For unloading, we found one significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) for muscle area and five QTLs for cortical bone without overlap between mechano-sensitive muscle and cortical bone QTLs (but some overlap between muscle and trabecular QTLs). The low correlations between morphological changes in muscle and bone, together with the largely distinct genetic regulation of the response indicate that the premise of a muscle-bone unit that co-adjusts its size during (un)loading may need to be reassessed.",

        "Abstract": "Osteocyte apoptosis is essential to activate bone remodeling in response to fatigue microdamage and estrogen withdrawal, such that apoptosis inhibition in vivo prevents the onset of osteoclastic resorption. Osteocyte apoptosis has also been spatially linked to bone resorption owing to disuse, but whether apoptosis plays a similar controlling role is unclear. We, therefore, 1) evaluated the spatial and temporal effects of disuse from hindlimb unloading (HLU) on osteocyte apoptosis, receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) expression, bone resorption, and loss in mouse femora, and 2) tested whether osteocyte apoptosis was required to activate osteoclastic activity in cortical and trabecular bone by treating animals subjected to HLU with the pan-caspase apoptosis inhibitor, QVD (quinolyl-valyl-O-methylaspartyl-[-2,6-difluorophenoxy]-methylketone). Immunohistochemistry was used to identify apoptotic and RANKL-producing osteocytes in femoral diaphysis and distal trabecular bone, and \u03bcCT was used to determine the extent of trabecular bone loss owing to HLU. In both cortical and trabecular bone, 5 days of HLU increased osteocyte apoptosis significantly (3- and 4-fold, respectively, p < 0.05 versus Ctrl). At day 14, the apoptotic osteocyte number in femoral cortices declined to near control levels but remained elevated in trabeculae (3-fold versus Ctrl, p < 0.05). The number of osteocytes producing RANKL in both bone compartments was also significantly increased at day 5 of HLU (>1.5-fold versus Ctrl, p <0.05) and further increased by day 14. Increases in osteocyte apoptosis and RANKL production preceded increases in bone resorption at both endocortical and trabecular surfaces. QVD completely inhibited not only the HLU-triggered increases in osteocyte apoptosis but also RANKL production and activation of bone resorption at both sites. Finally, \u03bcCT studies revealed that apoptosis inhibition completely prevented the trabecular bone loss caused by HLU. Together these data indicate that osteocyte apoptosis plays a central and controlling role in triggering osteocyte RANKL production and the activation of new resorption leading to bone loss in disuse.",

        "Abstract": "The forces generated by gravity have shaped life on Earth and impact gene expression and morphogenesis during early development. Conversely, disuse on Earth or during spaceflight, reduces normal mechanical loading of organisms, resulting in altered cell and tissue function. Although gravity mechanical loading in adult mammals is known to promote increased cell proliferation and differentiation, little is known about how distinct cell types respond to gravity mechanostimulation during early development. In this study we sought to understand, with single cell RNA-sequencing resolution, how a 60-min pulse of 50 g hypergravity (HG)/5 kPa hydrostatic pressure, influences transcriptomic regulation of developmental processes in the embryoid body (EB) model. Our study included both day-9 EBs and progenitor mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with or without the HG pulse. Single cell t-distributed stochastic neighbor mapping shows limited transcriptome shifts in response to the HG pulse in either ESCs or EBs; this pulse however, induces greater positional shifts in EB mapping compared to ESCs, indicating the influence of mechanotransduction is more pronounced in later states of cell commitment within the developmental program. More specifically, HG resulted in upregulation of self-renewal and angiogenesis genes in ESCs, while in EBs, HG loading was associated with upregulation of Gene Ontology-pathways for multicellular development, mechanical signal transduction, and DNA damage repair. Cluster transcriptome analysis of the EBs show HG promotes maintenance of transitory cell phenotypes in early development; including EB cluster co-expression of markers for progenitor, post-implant epiblast, and primitive endoderm phenotypes with HG pulse but expression exclusivity in the non-pulsed clusters. Pseudotime analysis identified three branching cell types susceptible to HG induction of cell fate decisions. In totality, this study provides novel evidence that ESC maintenance and EB development can be regulated by gravity mechanostimulation and that stem cells committed to a differentiation program are more sensitive to gravity-induced changes to their transcriptome.",
        "Conclusion": "This study offers a novel assessment of how in vitro ESC maintenance and EB development can be regulated by a positive pulse of gravity loading at single cell resolution. Specifically, we show that a 60-min 50 g/5 kPa HG pulse resulted in cells during early development maintaining transitory phenotypes, and having enhanced expression of germ layer lineage markers. This study further defines the power of gravity loading in regulating stem cell self-renewal and differentiation by identification of transcriptomic patterns in stem cells and developmental processes, which can aid in understanding how gravity can be leveraged to elicit regenerative responses; benefiting in vitro platforms for organoid tissue culture, and regenerative medicine.",

Exactly how immune mechanisms control A. fumigatus in immunocompetent individuals remains unclear. Here, we use transparent zebrafish larvae to visualize and quantify neutrophil and macrophage behaviors in response to different A. fumigatus strains. We find that macrophages form dense clusters around spores, establishing a protective niche for fungal survival. Macrophages exert these protective effects by inhibiting fungal germination, thereby inhibiting subsequent neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil-mediated killing. Germination directly drives fungal clearance as faster-growing CEA10-derived strains are killed better in vivo than slower-growing Af293-derived strains. Additionally, a CEA10 pyrG-deficient strain with impaired germination is cleared less effectively by neutrophils. Host inflammatory activation through Myd88 is required for killing of a CEA10-derived strain but not sufficient for killing of an Af293-derived strain, further demonstrating the role of fungal-intrinsic differences in the ability of a host to clear an infection. Altogether, we describe a new role for macrophages in the persistence of A. fumigatus and highlight the ability of different A. fumigatus strains to adopt diverse modes of virulence.",

        "Abstract": "Fungal spores contain secondary metabolites that can protect them from a multitude of abiotic and biotic stresses. Conidia (asexual spores) of the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus synthesize several metabolites, including melanin, which has been reported to be important for virulence in this species and to be protective against UV radiation in other fungi. Here, we investigate the role of melanin in diverse isolates of A. fumigatus and find variability in its ability to protect spores from UV-C radiation or impact virulence in a zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis in two clinical strains and one ISS strain. Further, we assess the role of other spore metabolites in a clinical strain of A. fumigatus and identify fumiquinazoline as an additional UV-C-protective molecule but not a virulence determinant. The results show differential roles of secondary metabolites in spore protection dependent on the environmental stress and strain of A. fumigatus. As protection from elevated levels of radiation is of paramount importance for future human outer space explorations, the discovery of small molecules with radiation-protective potential may result in developing novel safety measures for astronauts.",

Our analyses of the melanotic mutant dappled have revealed a novel type of gene involved in blood cell regulation. The dappled gene is an essential gene that encodes cytochrome b5, a conserved hemoprotein that participates in electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions and pathways. Viable mutations of dappled cause melanotic nodules and hemocyte misregulation during both hematopoietic waves of development. The sexes are similarly affected, but hemocyte number is different in females and males of both mutants and wild type. Additionally, initial tests show that curcumin enhances the dappled melanotic phenotype and establish screening of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds as a route for analysis of cytochrome b5 function. Overall, dappled provides a tractable genetic model for cytochrome b5, which has been difficult to study in higher organisms.",

        "Abstract": "Main conclusion Blue-light positive phototropism in roots is masked by gravity and revealed in conditions of microgravity. In addition, the magnitude of red-light positive phototropic curvature is correlated to the magnitude of gravity. Due to their sessile nature, plants utilize environmental cues to grow and respond to their surroundings. Two of these cues, light and gravity, play a substantial role in plant orientation and directed growth movements (tropisms). However, very little is currently known about the interaction between light- (phototropic) and gravity (gravitropic)-mediated growth responses. Utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System on board the International Space Station, we investigated the interaction between phototropic and gravitropic responses in three Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes, Landsberg wild type, as well as mutants of phytochrome A and phytochrome B. Onboard centrifuges were used to create a fractional gravity gradient ranging from reduced gravity up to 1g. A novel positive blue-light phototropic response of roots was observed during conditions of microgravity, and this response was attenuated at 0.1g. In addition, a red-light pretreatment of plants enhanced the magnitude of positive phototropic curvature of roots in response to blue illumination. In addition, a positive phototropic response of roots was observed when exposed to red light, and a decrease in response was gradual and correlated with the increase in gravity.

Transcriptomic analyses allow the identification of adaptation response pathways by detecting changes in gene expression at the global genome level caused by the main factors of the space environment, namely altered gravity and cosmic radiation. This article reviews transcriptomic studies carried out from plants grown in spaceflights and in different ground-based microgravity simulators. Despite differences in plant growth conditions, these studies have shown that cell wall remodeling, oxidative stress, defense response, and photosynthesis are common altered processes in plants grown under spaceflight conditions. European scientists have significantly contributed to the acquisition of this knowledge, e.g., by showing the role of red light in the adaptation response of plants (EMCS experiments) and the mechanisms of cellular response and adaptation mostly affecting cell cycle regulation, using cell cultures in microgravity simulators.",

        "Abstract": "Tropisms are growth-mediated plant movements that help plants to respond to changes in environmental stimuli. The availability of water and light, as well as the presence of a constant gravity vector, are all environmental stimuli that plants sense and respond to via directed growth movements (tropisms). The plant response to gravity (gravitropism) and the response to unidirectional light (phototropism) have long been shown to be interconnected growth phenomena. Here, we discuss the similarities in these two processes, as well as the known molecular mechanisms behind the tropistic responses. We also highlight research done in a microgravity environment in order to decouple two tropisms through experiments carried out in the absence of a significant unilateral gravity vector. In addition, alteration of gravity, especially the microgravity environment, and light irradiation produce important effects on meristematic cells, the undifferentiated, highly proliferating, totipotent cells which sustain plant development. Microgravity produces the disruption of meristematic competence, i.e., the decoupling of cell proliferation and cell growth, affecting the regulation of the cell cycle and ribosome biogenesis. Light irradiation, especially red light, mediated by phytochromes, has an activating effect on these processes. Phytohormones, particularly auxin, also are key mediators in these alterations. Upcoming experiments on the International Space Station will clarify some of the mechanisms and molecular players of the plant responses to these environmental signals involved in tropisms and the cell cycle.",

Thus, it is important to understand the effects of microgravity and spaceflight on gene expression in plant development. METHODSWe analyzed the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana using the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) hardware during Space Shuttle mission STS-131. The bioinformatics methods used included RMA (robust multi-array average), MAS5 (Microarray Suite 5.0), and PLIER (probe logarithmic intensity error estimation). Glycome profiling was used to analyze cell wall composition in the samples. In addition, our results were compared to those of two other groups using the same hardware on the same mission (BRIC-16). KEY RESULTSIn our BRIC-16 experiments, we noted expression changes in genes involved in hypoxia and heat shock responses, DNA repair, and cell wall structure between spaceflight samples compared to the ground controls. In addition, glycome profiling supported our expression analyses in that there was a difference in cell wall components between ground control and spaceflight-grown plants. Comparing our studies to those of the other BRIC-16 experiments demonstrated that, even with the same hardware and similar biological materials, differences in results in gene expression were found among these spaceflight experiments. C ONCLUSIONSA common theme from our BRIC-16 space experiments and those of the other two groups was the downregulation of water stress response genes in spaceflight. In addition, all three studies found differential regulation of genes associated with cell wall remodeling and stress responses between spaceflight-grown and ground control plants.",

        "Abstract": "Introduction: Traveling to nearby extraterrestrial objects having a reduced gravity level (partial gravity) compared to Earth\u2019s gravity is becoming a realistic objective for space agencies. The use of plants as part of life support systems will require a better understanding of the interactions among plant growth responses including tropisms, under partial gravity conditions. Materials and Methods: Here, we present results from our latest space experiments on the ISS, in which seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana were germinated, and seedlings grew for six days under different gravity levels, namely micro-g, several intermediate partial-g levels, and 1g, and were subjected to irradiation with blue light for the last 48 h. RNA was extracted from 20 samples for subsequent RNAseq analysis. Transcriptomic analysis was performed using the HISAT2-Stringtie-DESeq pipeline. Differentially expressed genes were further characterized for global responses using the GEDI tool, gene networks and for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment. Results: Differential gene expression analysis revealed only one differentially expressed gene (AT4G21560, VPS28-1 a vacuolar protein) across all gravity conditions using FDR correction (q < 0.05). However, the same 14 genes appeared differentially expressed when comparing either micro-g, low-g level (< 0.1g) or the Moon g-level with 1g control conditions. Apart from these 14-shared genes, the number of differentially expressed genes was similar in microgravity and the Moon g-level and increased in the intermediate g-level (< 0.1g), but it was then progressively reduced as the difference with the Earth gravity became smaller. The GO groups were differentially affected at each g-level: light and photosynthesis GO under microgravity, genes belonged to general stress, chemical and hormone responses under low-g, and a response related to cell wall and membrane structure and function under the Moon g-level. Discussion: Transcriptional analyses of plants under blue light stimulation suggests that root blue-light phototropism may be enough to reduce the gravitational stress response caused by the lack of gravitropism in microgravity. Competition among tropisms induces an intense perturbation at the micro-g level, which shows an extensive stress response that is progressively attenuated. Our results show a major effect on cell wall/membrane remodeling (detected at the interval from the Moon to Mars gravity), which can be potentially related to graviresistance mechanisms.",
        "Conclusion": "The results of this study take advantage of the induction of subtle blue-light phototropism in roots in spaceflight to discern the transcriptional responses to different tropisms in orbit. Removal of the influence of gravity on blue-light-illuminated seedlings showed a reduction in gene expression in multiple pathways associated with photosynthesis, suggesting shared molecular pathways between the two tropistic responses, or a functional compensation among them. It is important to emphasize that the effects shown at microgravity here are gradually removed by increasing g-load. While the phototropic effect is noted at the microgravity level, a general stress response is detected at <0.1g, probably due to conflicting stimuli, just at the detection threshold of photo- and gravi-sensing mechanisms. Membrane-related gene ontologies became the more significant at the Moon g-level, and they become progressively weaker at higher g-levels, allowing us to discriminate the differential contribution of the classical statolith-based gravitropism from other responses based on cell tensegrity that may require a higher g-threshold to be fully active (Hoson et al., 2005; Hoson and Wakabayashi, 2015). Therefore, our results are starting to isolate, at the whole transcriptional level, the global effects that are produced by the gravitropism, phototropism and graviresistance mechanisms, working at different g-level thresholds. Future use of mutant lines will help us to confirm and extend these findings, which suggests an intricate connection between gravity and light perception in A. thaliana. In the long term, these results on the interaction among tropisms will be important for the use of plants in bioregenerative support systems needed for the human exploration of the Solar System.",

        "Abstract": "Life on Earth has evolved under the influence of gravity. This force has played an important role in shaping development and morphology from the molecular level to the whole organism. Although aquatic life experiences reduced gravity effects, land plants have evolved under a 1-g environment. Understanding gravitational effects requires changing the magnitude of this force. One method of eliminating gravity'\u2019s influence is to enter into a free-fall orbit around the planet, thereby achieving a balance between centripetal force of gravity and the centrifugal force of the moving object. This balance is often mistakenly referred to as microgravity, but is best described as weightlessness. In addition to actually compensating gravity, instruments such as clinostats, random-positioning machines (RPM), and magnetic levitation devices have been used to eliminate effects of constant gravity on plant growth and development. However, these platforms do not reduce gravity but constantly change its direction. Despite these fundamental differences, there are few studies that have investigated the comparability between these platforms and weightlessness. Here, we provide a review of the strengths and weaknesses of these analogs for the study of plant growth and development compared to spaceflight experiments. We also consider reduced or partial gravity effects via spaceflight and analog methods. While these analogs are useful, the fidelity of the results relative to spaceflight depends on biological parameters and environmental conditions that cannot be simulated in ground-based studies.",
        "Conclusion": "Numerous studies have compared the biological effects of clinostats and other microgravity analogs to space experiments (e.g., Brown et al., 1996; Kraft et al., 2000; Herranz et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2018). The experiments to date suggest that while these devices may be useful tools in some cases, there are great differences observed between plants that grow and develop on these devices and plants that are grown in weightlessness during spaceflight. In fact, rotation on certain types of clinostats may have deleterious effects in some biological systems (Hensel and Sievers, 1980; Kozeko et al., 2018; Ruden et al., 2018). The conditions under which ground-based simulation can provide useful information and compare various gravitational regimens need to be systematically determined through carefully controlled experiments in which ground analog studies are compared with spaceflight experiments. A problem with past studies of microgravity simulators/analogs is that it can be difficult to compare results between spaceflight experiments to those of simulation devices (Herranz et al., 2013). Thus, ground-based experiments should be performed to maximize comparability between spaceflight and experimental ground-based devices. For example, in plant studies, factors to consider include identical seed stock, growth substrate, nutrient media, and light composition and intensity. In addition, containers should be identical for space and ground-based studies. This latter consideration can be made difficult by the reluctance of space agencies to provide access to their expensive spaceflight hardware (Kiss, 2015). Nevertheless, in this era of the International Space Station, we must take advantage of its unique facilities to compare effects observed in clinostats and other space simulators. We also should use the centrifuges available on the ISS to systematically explore the effects of partial gravity on plant growth and development. Understanding plant biology in space under different gravity levels will be useful as we develop technologies needed for human habitation of other worlds.",

Spaceflight produces deleterious effects on plant cells, particularly affecting ribosome biogenesis, a complex stress-sensitive process coordinated with cell division and differentiation, known to be activated by red light. Here, in a series of ground studies, we have used mutants from the two Arabidopsis nucleolin genes (NUC1 and NUC2, nucleolar regulators of ribosome biogenesis) to better understand their role in adaptive response mechanisms to stress on Earth. Thus, we show that nucleolin stress-related gene NUC2 can compensate for the environmental stress provided by darkness in nuc1 plants, whereas nuc2 plants are not able to provide a complete response to red light. These ground control findings, as part of the ESA/NASA Seedling Growth spaceflight experiments, will determine the basis for the identification of genetic backgrounds enabling an adaptive advantage for plants in future space experiments.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding the response of plants to varied gravitational conditions is vital for developing effective food production in space bioregenerative life support systems. This study examines the impact of altered gravity conditions on the growth and morphological responses of Wolffia globosa (commonly known as \u201cwater lentils\u201d or \u201cduckweed\u201d), assessing its potential as a space crop. Although an experiment testing the effect of simulated microgravity on Wolffia globosa has been previously conducted, for the first time, we investigated the effect of multiple gravity levels on the growth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa plants. The plant responses to simulated microgravity, simulated partial gravity (Moon), and hypergravity environments were evaluated using random positioning machines and the large-diameter centrifuge. As hypothesized, we observed a slight reaction to different gravitational levels in the growth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa. The relative growth rates (RGR) of plants subjected to simulated microgravity and partial gravity were reduced when compared to those in other gravity levels. The morphological analysis revealed differences in plant dimensions and frond length-to-width ratios under diverse gravity conditions. Our findings showed that Wolffia globosa is responsive to gravitational changes, with its growth and morphological adaptations being slightly influenced by varying gravitational environments. As for other crop species, growth was reduced by the microgravity conditions; however, RGR remained substantial at 0.33 a day. In conclusion, this study underscores the potential of Wolffia globosa as a space crop and its adaptability to diverse gravitational conditions, contributing to the development of sustainable food production and bioregenerative life support systems for future space exploration missions.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract Understanding how plants respond and adapt to extraterrestrial conditions is essential for space exploration initiatives. Deleterious effects of the space environment on plant development have been reported, such as the unbalance of cell growth and proliferation in the root meristem, or gene expression reprogramming. However, plants are capable of surviving and completing the seed-to-seed life cycle under microgravity. A key research challenge is to identify environmental cues, such as light, which could compensate the negative effects of microgravity. Understanding the crosstalk between light and gravity sensing in space was the major objective of the NASA-ESA Seedling Growth series of spaceflight experiments (2013\u20132018). Different g-levels were used, with special attention to micro-g, Mars-g, and Earth-g. In spaceflight seedlings illuminated for 4 days with a white light photoperiod and then photostimulated with red light for 2 days, transcriptomic studies showed, first, that red light partially reverted the gene reprogramming induced by microgravity, and that the combination of microgravity and photoactivation was not recognized by seedlings as stressful. Two mutant lines of the nucleolar protein nucleolin exhibited differential requirements in response to red light photoactivation. This observation opens the way to directed-mutagenesis strategies in crop design to be used in space colonization. Further transcriptomic studies at different g-levels showed elevated plastid and mitochondrial genome expression in microgravity, associated with disturbed nucleus\u2013organelle communication, and the upregulation of genes encoding auxin and cytokinin hormonal pathways. At the Mars g-level, genes of hormone pathways related to stress response were activated, together with some transcription factors specifically related to acclimation, suggesting that seedlings grown in partial-g are able to acclimate by modulating genome expression in routes related to space-environment-associated stress.",

        "Abstract": "Reduced mechanical loading during bedrest, spaceflight, and casting, causes rapid morphological changes in skeletal muscle: fiber atrophy and reduction of slow-twitch fibers. An emerging signaling event in response to unloading is the translocation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS\u03bc) from the sarcolemma to the cytosol. We used EUK-134, a cell-permeable mimetic of superoxide dismutase and catalase, to test the role of redox signaling in nNOS\u03bc translocation and muscle fiber atrophy as a result of short-term (54 h) hindlimb unloading. Fischer-344 rats were divided into ambulatory control, hindlimb-unloaded (HU), and hindlimb-unloaded + EUK-134 (HU-EUK) groups. EUK-134 mitigated the unloading-induced phenotype, including muscle fiber atrophy and muscle fiber-type shift from slow to fast. nNOS\u03bc immunolocalization at the sarcolemma of the soleus was reduced with HU, while nNOS\u03bc protein content in the cytosol increased with unloading. Translocation of nNOS from the sarcolemma to cytosol was virtually abolished by EUK-134. EUK-134 also mitigated dephosphorylation at Thr-32 of FoxO3a during HU. Hindlimb unloading elevated oxidative stress (4-hydroxynonenal) and increased sarcolemmal localization of Nox2 subunits gp91phox (Nox2) and p47phox, effects normalized by EUK-134. Thus, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that oxidative stress triggers nNOS\u03bc translocation from the sarcolemma and FoxO3a dephosphorylation as an early event during mechanical unloading. Thus, redox signaling may serve as a biological switch for nNOS to initiate morphological changes in skeletal muscle fibers.",

        "Abstract": "Contractility of the heart is impaired with advancing age via mechanical remodeling, as myocytes are lost through apoptosis and collagenous fibers accumulate. Exercise training confers protection against fibrosis and apoptosis in the aging heart, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. We recently reported that exercise training elevates Mn isoform of superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in the aging heart, concomitant with reduction in oxidative stress and fibrosis. Here, we tested the hypothesis that overexpression of MnSOD would be causal in protection against fibrosis and apoptosis in the aging heart. Hearts were extracted from young (8 months) wild-type, young mice overexpressing the Sod2 (MnSOD) gene, old (28 months) wild-type, and old transgenic mice. Left ventricle MnSOD protein levels were elevated in young mice overexpressing the Sod2 (MnSOD) gene and old transgenic mice. MnSODTg mice exhibited lower oxidative stress (total hydroperoxides, 4-hydroxynonenal, and 8-isoprostane) in the old group. Age-related cardiac remodeling and fibrosis was mitigated in MnSOD Tg mice with reductions in extramyocyte space (\u221265%), collagen-I, and transforming growth factor-\u03b2. Pro-apoptotic markers Bax (\u221238%) and caspase-3 cleavage (\u221241%) were reduced and apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling-positive nuclei, DNA laddering) was mitigated in MnSOD Tg hearts compared with old wild-type. We conclude that MnSOD elevation is indeed protective against oxidative stress, fibrosis, and apoptosis in the aging heart.",

        "Abstract": "Apoptosis plays an important role in atrophy and sarcopenia in skeletal muscle. Recent evidence suggests that insufficient heat shock proteins (HSPs) may contribute to apoptosis and muscle wasting. In addition, long-term caloric restriction (CR) and lifelong wheel running exercise (WR) with CR provide significant protection against caspase-dependent apoptosis and sarcopenia. Caspase-independent mediators (endonuclease G: EndoG; apoptosis-inducing factor: AIF) of apoptosis are also linked to muscles wasting with disuse and aging. However, the efficacy of CR and WR with CR to attenuate caspase-independent apoptosis and preserve HSPs in aging skeletal muscle are unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that CR and WR with CR would ameliorate age-induced elevation of EndoG and AIF while protecting HSP27 and HSP70 levels in the plantaris. Male Fischer-344 rats were divided into 4 groups at 11 weeks: ad libitum feeding until 6 mo. (YAL); fed ad libitum until 24 mo. old (OAL); 8%CR to 24 mo. (OCR); WR + 8%CR to 24 mo. (OExCR). Nuclear EndoG levels were significantly higher in OAL (+153%) than in YAL, while CR (\u221238%) and WR with CR (\u221246%) significantly attenuated age-induced increment in nuclear EndoG. HSP27 (\u221263%) protein content and phosphorylation at Ser82 (\u221249%) were significantly lower in OAL than in YAL, while HSP27 protein content was significantly higher in OCR (+136%) and OExCR (+155%) and p-HSP27 (+254%) was significantly higher in OExCR compared with OAL, respectively. In contrast, AIF and HSP70 were unaltered by CR or WR with CR in aging muscle. These data indicate that CR and WR with CR attenuate age-associated upregulation of EndoG translocation in the nucleus, potentially involved with HSP27 signaling.",

        "Abstract": "Age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, referred to as sarcopenia, is mitigated by lifelong calorie restriction as well as exercise. In aged skeletal muscle fibers there is compromised integrity of the cell membrane that may contribute to sarcopenia. The purpose of this study was to determine if lifelong mild (8%) caloric restriction (CR) and lifelong CR + voluntary wheel running (WR) could ameliorate disruption of membrane scaffolding and signaling proteins during the aging process, thus maintaining a favorable, healthy membrane environment in plantaris muscle fibers. Fischer-344 rats were divided into four groups: 24-month old adults fed ad libitum (OAL); 24-month old on 8% caloric restriction (OCR); 24 month old 8% caloric restriction + wheel running (OCRWR); 6-month old sedentary adults fed ad libitum (YAL) were used to determine age-related changes. Aging resulted in discontinuous membrane expression of dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) proteins: dystrophin and \u03b1-syntrophin. Older muscle also displayed decreased content of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), a key DGC signaling protein. In contrast, OCR and OCRWR provided significant protection against age-related DGC disruption. In conjunction with the age-related decline in membrane DGC patency, key membrane repair proteins (MG53, dysferlin, annexin A6, and annexin A2) were significantly increased in the OAL plantaris. However, lifelong CR and CRWR interventions were effective at maintaining membrane repair proteins near YAL levels of. OAL fibers also displayed reduced protein content of NADPH oxidase isoform 2 (Nox2) subunits (p67phox and p47phox), consistent with a perturbed sarcolemmal environment. Loss of Nox2 subunits was prevented by lifelong CR and CRWR. Our results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that lifelong CR and WR are effective countermeasures against age-related alterations in the myofiber membrane environment.",

        "Abstract": "Mechanical unloading during microgravity causes skeletal muscle atrophy and impairs mitochondrial energetics. The elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by mitochondria and Nox2, coupled with impairment of stress protection (e.g., SIRT1, antioxidant enzymes), contribute to atrophy. We tested the hypothesis that the SIRT1 activator, SRT2104 would rescue unloading-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial function in rat gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were evaluated under three conditions (10 days): ambulatory control (CON), hindlimb unloaded (HU), and hindlimb-unloaded-treated with SRT2104 (SIRT). Oxidative phosphorylation, electron transfer capacities, H2O2 production, and oxidative and antioxidant enzymes were quantified using high-resolution respirometry and colorimetry. In the gastrocnemius, (1) integrative (per mg tissue) proton LEAK was lesser in SIRT than in HU or CON; (2) intrinsic (relative to citrate synthase) maximal noncoupled electron transfer capacity (ECI+II) was lesser, while complex I-supported oxidative phosphorylation to ECI+II was greater in HU than CON; (3) the contribution of LEAK to ECI+II was greatest, but cytochrome c oxidase activity was lowest in HU. In both muscles, H2O2 production and concentration was greatest in SIRT, as was gastrocnemius superoxide dismutase activity. In the soleus, H2O2 concentration was greater in HU compared to CON. These results indicate that SRT2104 preserves mitochondrial function in unloaded skeletal muscle, suggesting its potential to support healthy muscle cells in microgravity by promoting necessary energy production in mitochondria.",

        "Abstract": "Skeletal muscles overcome terrestrial, gravitational loading by producing tensile forces that produce movement through joint rotation. Conversely, the microgravity of spaceflight reduces tensile loads in working skeletal muscles, causing an adaptive muscle atrophy. Unfortunately, the design of stable, physiological bioreactors to model skeletal muscle tensile loading during spaceflight experiments remains challenging. Here, we tested a bioreactor that uses initiation and cessation of cyclic, tensile strain to induce hypertrophy and atrophy, respectively, in murine lineage (C2C12) skeletal muscle myotubes. Uniaxial cyclic stretch of myotubes was conducted using a StrexCell\u00ae (STB-1400) stepper motor system (0.75 Hz, 12% strain, 60 min day^-1). Myotube groups were assigned as follows: (a) quiescent over 2- or (b) 5-day (no stretch), (c) experienced 2-days (2dHY) or (d) 5-days (5dHY) of cyclic stretch, or (e) 2-days of cyclic stretch followed by a 3-day cessation of stretch (3dAT). Using \u00df-sarcoglycan as a sarcolemmal marker, mean myotube diameter increased significantly following 2dAT (51%) and 5dAT (94%) vs. matched controls. The hypertrophic, anabolic markers talin and Akt phosphorylation (Thr308) were elevated with 2dHY but not in 3dAT myotubes. Inflammatory, catabolic markers IL-1\u00df, IL6, and NF-kappaB p65 subunit were significantly higher in the 3dAT group vs. all other groups. The ratio of phosphorylated FoxO3a/total FoxO3a was significantly lower in 3dAT than in the 2dHY group, consistent with elevated catabolic signaling during unloading. In summary, we demonstrated proof-of-concept for a spaceflight research bioreactor, using uniaxial cyclic stretch to produce myotube hypertrophy with increased tensile loading, and myotube atrophy with subsequent cessation of stretch.",

        "Abstract": "Urine, humidity condensate, and other sources of non-potable water are processed onboard the International Space Station (ISS) by the Water Recovery System (WRS) yielding potable water. While some means of microbial control are in place, including a phosphoric acid/hexavalent chromium urine pretreatment solution, many areas within the WRS are not available for routine microbial monitoring. Due to refurbishment needs, two flex lines from the Urine Processor Assembly (UPA) within the WRS were removed and returned to Earth. The water from within these lines, as well as flush water, was microbially evaluated. Culture and culture-independent analysis revealed the presence of Burkholderia, Paraburkholderia, and Leifsonia. Fungal culture also identified Fusarium and Lecythophora. Hybrid de novo genome analysis of the five distinct Burkholderia isolates identified them as B. contaminans, while the two Paraburkholderia isolates were identified as P. fungorum. Chromate-resistance gene clusters were identified through pangenomic analysis that differentiated these genomes from previously studied isolates recovered from the point-of-use potable water dispenser and/or current NCBI references, indicating that unique populations exist within distinct niches in the WRS. Beyond genomic analysis, fixed samples directly from the lines were imaged by environmental scanning electron microscopy, which detailed networks of fungal-bacterial biofilms. This is the first evidence of biofilm formation within flex lines from the UPA onboard the ISS. For all bacteria isolated, biofilm potential was further characterized, with the B. contaminans isolates demonstrating the most considerable biofilm formation. Moreover, the genomes of the B. contaminans revealed secondary metabolite gene clusters associated with quorum sensing, biofilm formation, antifungal compounds, and hemolysins. The potential production of these gene cluster metabolites was phenotypically evaluated through biofilm, bacterial-fungal interaction, and hemolytic assays. Collectively, these data identify the UPA flex lines as a unique ecological niche and novel area of biofilm growth within the WRS. Further investigation of these organisms and their resistance profiles will enable engineering controls directed toward biofilm prevention in future space station water systems.",
        "Conclusion": "4  The WRS has been providing potable water to astronauts onboard the ISS since 2009. However, our current understanding of the microbial community within the system is limited to the WPA wastewater tank and point-of-use PWD samples. This work represents the first investigation into the unique community that inhabits the UPA. From the UPA115 flex line, a purge line carrying water vapor to the DA, three differing morphologies of B. contaminans, as well as P. fungorum, L. lichenia, and an unidentified Gram-positive bacterium, were isolated; additionally, the fungi Fusarium sp. and L. mutabilis were isolated. Less diversity was noted from samples recovered from the UPA95 flex line, where concentrated levels of chromium are encountered, from which two different morphologies of B. contaminans, P. fungorum, and Fusarium sp. were isolated. For the five B. contaminans isolates, multiple chromate-resistance and transporter protein gene clusters were identified through pangenomic analysis that differentiated these genomes from previously studied isolates recovered from the PWD. Moreover, the UPA P. fungorum isolates contained a gene cluster associated with chromate resistance that was absent in the current NCBI references. The acquisition of these resistance gene clusters by these organisms, as compared to both those from the WPA and terrestrial environments, distinguishes these flex lines as a unique ecological niche. Furthermore, this highlights that the flex lines, as well as other areas within the UPA, are ideal candidate areas to investigate horizontal gene transfer. As a dormant water system is a likely option for future spacecraft, e.g. the Lunar Gateway, where biofouling is a significant concern, biofilm analysis and imaging was performed. ESEM imaging of the water from the flex lines and biofilm potential of the recovered isolates demonstrated that these hoses are novel areas for fungal-bacterial biofilm growth. While NASA has a strong biofilm control campaign, the organisms used in these studies have been limited to those isolated from the WPA. Further analysis of isolates from the UPA, displaying a greater range of genetic and phenotypic properties, as well as the fungal-bacterial interactions at play within these biofilms, should be a high priority to aid in the design of engineering controls directed toward biofilm prevention in next generation water systems.",

        "Abstract": "We present CAMDLES (CFD-DEM Artificial Microgravity Developments for Living Ecosystem Simulation), an extension of CFDEM\u00aeCoupling to model biological flows, growth, and mass transfer in artificial microgravity devices. For microbes that accompany humans into space, microgravity-induced alterations in the fluid environment are likely to be a major factor in the microbial experience of spaceflight. Computational modeling is needed to investigate how well ground-based microgravity simulation methods replicate that experience. CAMDLES incorporates agent-based modeling to study inter-species metabolite transport within microbial communities in rotating wall vessel bioreactors (RWVs). Preexisting CFD modeling of RWVs has not yet incorporated growth; CAMDLES employs the simultaneous modeling of biological, chemical, and mechanical processes in a micro-scale rotating reference frame environment. Simulation mass transfer calculations were correlated with Monod dynamic parameters to predict relative growth rates between artificial microgravity, spaceflight microgravity, and 1 g conditions. By simulating a microbial model community of metabolically cooperative strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, we found that the greatest difference between microgravity and an RWV or 1 g gravity was when species colocalized in dense aggregates. We also investigated the influence of other features of the system on growth, such as spatial distribution, product yields, and diffusivity. Our simulation provides a basis for future laboratory experiments using this community for investigation in artificial microgravity and spaceflight microgravity. More broadly, our development of these models creates a framework for novel hypothesis generation and design of biological experiments with RWVs, coupling the effects of RWV size, rotation rate, and mass transport directly to bacterial growth in microbial communities.",

        "Abstract": "The Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) is the largest research plant growth facility deployed on the International Space Station (ISS). APH is a fully enclosed, closed-loop plant life support system with an environmentally controlled growth chamber designed for conducting both fundamental and applied plant research during experiments extending as long as 135 days. APH was delivered to the ISS in parts aboard two commercial resupply missions: OA-7 in April 2017 and SpaceX-11 in June 2017, and was assembled and installed in the Japanese Experiment Module Kibo in November 2018. We report here on a 7-week-long hardware validation test that utilized a root module planted with both Arabidopsis (cv. Col 0) and wheat (cv. Apogee) plants. The validation test examined the APH\u2019s ability to control light intensity, spectral quality, humidity, CO2 concentration, photoperiod, temperature, and root zone moisture using commanding from ground facilities at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The test also demonstrated the execution of programmed experiment profiles that scheduled: (1) changes in environmental combinations (e.g., a daily photoperiod at constant relative humidity), (2) predetermined photographic events using the three APH cameras [overhead, sideview, and sideview near-infrared (NIR)], and (3) execution of experimental sequences during the life cycle of a crop (e.g., measure photosynthetic CO2 drawdown experiments). Arabidopsis and wheat were grown in microgravity to demonstrate crew procedures, planting protocols and watering schemes within APH. The ability of APH to contain plant debris was assessed during the harvest of mature Arabidopsis plants. Wheat provided a large evaporative load that tested root zone moisture control and the recovery of transpired water by condensation. The wheat canopy was also used to validate the ability of APH to measure gas exchange of plants from non-invasive gas exchange measurements (i.e., canopy photosynthesis and respiration). These features were evaluated by executing experiment profiles that utilized the CO2 drawdown technique to measure daily rates of canopy photosynthesis and dark-period CO2 increase for respiration. This hardware validation test confirmed that APH can measure fundamental plant responses to spaceflight conditions.",
        "Conclusion": "The APH Facility was installed, assembled and its ability for conducting fundamental plant research on ISS was evaluated and demonstrated. Wheat and Arabidopsis plant canopies were successfully grown from seed and harvested after 6 weeks and after 33 days of growth on ISS, respectively. No pre-flight testing was performed on the ground, thus design team recommended settings were used throughout the operation of the APH during the validation test. The planting, germination, and watering protocols for the two species were demonstrated on ISS. The ability to grow Arabidopsis stems, flowers and siliques was accomplished in 6 weeks and the APH\u2019s ability to contain debris during harvest was demonstrated during harvest of the mature Arabidopsis plants. Environmental and non-destructive plant growth data was collected and used to validate the ability of APH to measure photosynthesis, respiration and CQY of a plant canopy during spaceflight.",

        "Abstract": "Multiple Arabidopsis arogenate dehydratase (ADT) knock-out (KO) mutants, with phenotypes having variable lignin levels (up to circa 70% reduction), were studied to investigate how differential reductions in ADTs perturb its overall plant systems biology. Integrated \u201comics\u201d analyses (metabolome, transcriptome, and proteome) of wild type (WT), single and multiple ADT KO lines were conducted. Transcriptome and proteome data were collapsed into gene ortholog (GO) data, with this allowing for enzymatic reaction and metabolome cross-comparisons to uncover dominant or likely metabolic biosynthesis reactions affected. Network analysis of enzymes\u2013highly correlated to stem lignin levels\u2013deduced the involvement of novel putative lignin related proteins or processes. These included those associated with ribosomes, the spliceosome, mRNA transport, aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis, and phosphorylation. While prior work helped explain lignin biosynthesis regulation at the transcriptional level, our data here provide support for a new hypothesis that there are additional post-transcriptional and translational level processes that need to be considered. These findings are anticipated to lead to development of more accurate depictions of lignin/phenylpropanoid biosynthesis models in situ, with new protein targets identified for further biochemical analysis and/or plant bioengineering. Additionally, using KEGG defined functional categorization of proteomics and transcriptomics analyses, we detected significant changes to glucosinolate, \u03b1-linolenic acid, nitrogen, carotenoid, aromatic amino acid, phenylpropanoid, and photosynthesis-related metabolic pathways in ADT KO mutants. Metabolomics results also revealed that putative carotenoid and galactolipid levels were generally increased in amount, whereas many glucosinolates and phenylpropanoids (including flavonoids and lignans) were decreased in the KO mutants.",

Here, we investigated whether low dose charged particle irradiation could elicit oxidative stress in neural stem and precursor cells and whether radiation-induced changes in redox metabolism would coincide with cognitive impairment. Results: Low doses (<1 Gy) of charged particles caused an acute and persistent oxidative stress. Early after (<1 week) irradiation, increased levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species were generally dose responsive, but were less dependent on dose weeks to months thereafter. Exposure to ion fluences resulting in less than one ion traversal per cell was sufficient to elicit radiation-induced oxidative stress. Whole body irradiation triggered a compensatory response in the rodent brain that led to a significant increase in antioxidant capacity 2 weeks following exposure, before returning to background levels at week 4. Low dose irradiation was also found to significantly impair novel object recognition in mice 2 and 12 weeks following irradiation. Innovation: Data provide evidence that acute exposure of neural stem cells and the CNS to very low doses and fluences of charged particles can elicit a persisting oxidative stress lasting weeks to months that is associated with impaired cognition. Conclusions: Exposure to low doses of charged particles causes a persistent oxidative stress and cognitive impairment over protracted times. Data suggest that astronauts subjected to space radiation may develop a heightened risk for mission critical performance decrements in space, along with a risk of developing long-term neurocognitive sequelae.

        "Abstract": "Beta cell replacement therapy for type 1 diabetes (T1D) is undergoing a transformative shift, driven by advances in stem cell biology, gene editing, and tissue engineering. While islet transplantation has demonstrated proof-of-concept success in restoring endogenous insulin production, its clinical impact remains limited by donor scarcity, immune rejection, and procedural complexities. The emergence of stem cell-derived beta-like cells represents a paradigm shift, with initial clinical trials showing promising insulin secretion in vivo. However, translating these breakthroughs into scalable, widely accessible treatments poses significant challenges. Drawing parallels to space exploration, this paper argues that while scientific feasibility has been demonstrated, true accessibility remains elusive. Without a strategic shift, beta cell therapy risks becoming an elite intervention, restricted by cost and infrastructure. Lessons from gene and cell therapies for rare diseases highlight the dangers of unsustainable pricing and limited market viability. To bridge the \u201clast mile\u201d a Quality by Design approach is proposed, emphasizing scalability, ease of use, and economic feasibility from the outset. By emphasizing practical implementation over academic achievements, corporate interests, market economics, or patent constraints, beta cell therapy can progress from proof-of-concept to a viable, widely accessible treatment.",

        "Abstract": "The transcriptomic datasets of the plant model organism Arabidopsis thaliana grown in the International Space Station provided by GeneLab have been mined to isolate the impact of spaceflight microgravity on gene expressions related to root growth. A set of computational tools is used to identify the hub genes that respond differently in spaceflight with controlled lighting compared to on the ground. These computational tools based on graph-theoretic approaches are used to infer gene regulatory networks from the transcriptomic datasets. The three main algorithms used for network analyses are Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Pearson correlation, and the Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm. Graph-based spectral analyses reveal distinct properties of the spaceflight microgravity networks for the Wassilewskija (WS), Columbia (Col)-0, and mutant phytochromeD (phyD) ecotypes. The set of hub genes that are significantly altered in spaceflight microgravity are mainly involved in cell wall synthesis, protein transport, response to auxin, stress responses, and catabolic processes. Network analysis highlights five important root growth-regulating hub genes that have the highest outdegree distribution in spaceflight microgravity networks. These concerned genes coding for proteins are identified from the Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) corresponding to spaceflight total light environment. Furthermore, network analysis uncovers genes that encode nucleotide-diphospho-sugar interconversion enzymes that have higher transcriptional regulation in spaceflight microgravity and are involved in cell wall biosynthesis.",

        "Abstract": "Ionizing radiation present in extraterrestrial environment is an important factor that affects plants grown in spaceflight. Pearson correlation-based gene regulatory network inferencing from transcriptional responses of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana L. grown in real and simulated spaceflight conditions acquired by GeneLab, followed by topological and spectral analysis of the networks is performed. Gene regulatory subnetworks are extracted for DNA damage response processes. Analysis of radiation-induced ATR/ATM protein\u2013protein interactions in Arabidopsis reveals interaction profile similarities under low radiation doses suggesting novel mechanisms of DNA damage response involving non-radiation-induced genes regulating other stress responses in spaceflight. The Jaccard similarity index shows that the genes AT2G31320, AT4G21070, AT2G46610, and AT3G27060 perform similar functions under low doses of radiation. The incremental association Markov blanket method reveals non-radiation-induced genes linking DNA damage response to root growth and plant development. Eighteen radiation-induced genes and sixteen non-radiation-induced gene players have been identified from the ATR/ATM protein interaction complexes involved in heat, salt, water, osmotic stress responses, and plant organogenesis. Network analysis and logistic regression ranking detected AT3G27060, AT1G07500, AT5G66140, and AT3G21280 as key gene players involved in DNA repair processes. High atomic weight, high energy, and gamma photon radiation result in higher intensity of DNA damage response in the plant resulting in elevated values for several network measures such as spectral gap and girth. Nineteen flavonoid and carotenoid pigment activations involved in pigment biosynthesis processes are identified in low radiation dose total light spaceflight environment but are not found to have significant regulations under very high radiation dose environment.",

        "Abstract": "Space missions necessitate physiological and psychological adaptations to environmental factors not present on Earth, some of which present significant risks for the central nervous system (CNS) of crewmembers. One CNS region of interest is the adult olfactory bulb (OB), as OB structure and function are sensitive to environmental- and experience-induced regulation. It is currently unknown how the OB is altered by spaceflight. In this study, we evaluated OB volume and neurogenesis in mice shortly after a 13-day flight on Space Shuttle Atlantis [Space Transport System (STS)-135] relative to two groups of control mice maintained on Earth. Mice housed on Earth in animal enclosure modules that mimicked the conditions onboard STS-135 (AEM-Ground mice) had greater OB volume relative to mice maintained in standard housing on Earth (Vivarium mice), particularly in the granule (GCL) and glomerular (GL) cell layers. AEM-Ground mice also had more OB neuroblasts and fewer apoptotic cells relative to Vivarium mice. However, the AEM-induced increase in OB volume and neurogenesis was not seen in STS-135 mice (AEM-Flight mice), suggesting that spaceflight may have negated the positive effects of the AEM. In fact, when OB volume of AEM-Flight mice was considered, there was a greater density of apoptotic cells relative to AEM-Ground mice. Our findings suggest that factors present during spaceflight have opposing effects on OB size and neurogenesis, and provide insight into potential strategies to preserve OB structure and function during future space missions.",

        "Abstract": "PurposeSpace travel is associated with an exposure to low-dose rate ionizing radiation and the microgravity environment, both of which may lead to impairments in cardiac function. We used a mouse model to determine short- and long-term cardiac effects to simulated microgravity (hindlimb unloading; HU), continuous low-dose rate \u03b3-irradiation, or a combination of HU and low-dose rate \u03b3-irradiation. MethodsCardiac tissue was obtained from female, C57BL/6J mice 7 days, 1 month, 4 months, and 9 months following the completion of a 21 day exposure to HU or a 21 day exposure to low-dose rate \u03b3-irradiation (average dose rate of 0.01 cGy/h to a total of 0.04 Gy), or a 21 day simultaneous exposure to HU and low-dose rate \u03b3-irradiation. Immunoblot analysis, rt-PCR, high-performance liquid chromatography, and histology were used to assess inflammatory cell infiltration, cardiac remodeling, oxidative stress, and the methylation potential of cardiac tissue in 3 to 6 animals per group. ResultsThe combination of HU and \u03b3-irradiation demonstrated the strongest increase in reduced to oxidized glutathione ratios 7 days and 1 month after treatment, but a difference was no longer apparent after 9 months. On the other hand, no significant changes in 4-hydroxynonenal adducts was seen in any of the groups, at the measured endpoints. While manganese superoxide dismutase protein levels decreased 9 months after low-dose \u03b3-radiation, no changes were observed in expression of catalase or Nrf2, a transcription factor that determines the expression of several antioxidant enzymes, at the measured endpoints. Inflammatory marker, CD-2 protein content was significantly decreased in all groups 4 months after treatment. No significant differences were observed in \u03b1-smooth muscle cell actin protein content, collagen type III protein content or % total collagen. ConclusionsThis study has provided the first and relatively broad analysis of small molecule and protein markers of oxidative stress, T-lymphocyte infiltration, and cardiac remodeling in response to HU with simultaneous exposure to low-dose rate \u03b3-radiation. Results from the late observation time points suggest that the hearts had mostly recovered from these two experimental conditions. However, further research is needed with larger numbers of animals for a more robust statistical power to fully characterize the early and late effects of simulated microgravity combined with exposure to low-dose rate ionizing radiation on the heart.",

        "Abstract": "The health risks associated with spaceflight-induced ocular structural and functional damage has become a recent concern for NASA. The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1 g on the structure and integrity of the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the eye. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Ten week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on Space-X 12 at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on August, 2017. After a 35-day mission, mice were returned to Earth alive. Within 38 +/\u2212 4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for analysis. Ground control (GC) and vivarium control mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware or normal vivarium cages respectively. Repeated intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed before the flight launch and re-measured before the mice were euthanized after splashdown. IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4\u201319.3 mmHg vs 16.3\u201320.3 mmHg) (p < 0.05) for the left eye. Flight group had significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to control groups (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed that an increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the flight mice compared to controls gave strong indication of disturbance of BRB integrity. There were also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BRB-related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals. These data indicate a complex cellular response that may alter retina structure and BRB integrity following long-term spaceflight.",

        "Abstract": "Spaceflight poses many challenges for humans. Ground-based analogs typically focus on single parameters of spaceflight and their associated acute effects. This study assesses the long-term transcriptional effects following single and combination spaceflight analog conditions using the mouse model: simulated microgravity via hindlimb unloading (HLU) and/or low-dose \u03b3-ray irradiation (LDR) for 21 days, followed by 4 months of readaptation. Changes in gene expression and epigenetic modifications in brain samples during readaptation were analyzed by whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq) and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). The results showed minimal gene expression and cytosine methylation alterations at 4 months readaptation within single treatment conditions of HLU or LDR. In contrast, following combined HLU+LDR, gene expression and promoter methylation analyses showed multiple altered pathways involved in neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, the regulation of neuropeptides, and cellular signaling. In brief, neurological readaptation following combined chronic LDR and HLU is a dynamic process that involves pathways that regulate neuronal function and structure and may lead to late onset neurological sequelae.",

The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight alters gene expression profiles and induces oxidative damage in the retina.

Within 38 (+/\u22124) hours after splashdown, mice ocular tissues were collected for analysis. RNA sequencing detected 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in murine spaceflight retinas, which were enriched for genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories. Twelve DEGs were associated with retinitis pigmentosa, characterized by dystrophy of the photoreceptor layer rods and cones. Differentially expressed transcription factors indicated changes in chromatin structure, offering clues to the observed phenotypic changes. Immunofluorescence assays showed degradation of cone photoreceptors and increased retinal oxidative stress. Total retinal, retinal pigment epithelium, and choroid layer thickness were significantly lower after spaceflight. These results indicate that retinal performance may decrease over extended periods of spaceflight and cause visual impairment.",

        "Abstract": "There are serious concerns about possible late radiation damage to ocular tissue from prolonged space radiation exposure, and occupational and medical procedures. This study aimed to investigate the effects of whole-body high-energy proton exposure at a single dose on apoptosis, oxidative stress, and blood-retina barrier (BRB) integrity in the retina and optic nerve head (ONH) region and to compare these radiation-induced effects with those produced by fractionated dose. Six-month-old C57BL/6 male mice were either sham irradiated or received whole-body high energy proton irradiation at an acute single dose of 0.5 Gy or 12 equal dose fractions for a total dose of 0.5 Gy over twenty-five days. At four months following irradiation, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for histochemical analysis. Significant increases in the number of apoptotic cells were documented in the mouse retinas and ONHs that received proton radiation with a single or fractionated dose (p < 0.05). Immunochemical analysis revealed enhanced immunoreactivity for oxidative biomarker, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in the retina and ONH following single or fractionated protons with more pronounced changes observed with a single dose of 0.5 Gy. BRB integrity was also evaluated with biomarkers of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4), a water channel protein, a tight junction (TJ) protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and an adhesion molecule, the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1). A significantly increased expression of AQP-4 was observed in the retina following a single dose exposure compared to controls. There was also a significant increase in the expression of PECAM-1 and a decrease in the expression of ZO-1 in the retina. These changes give a strong indication of disturbance to BRB integrity in the retina. Interestingly, there was very limited immunoreactivity of AQP-4 and ZO-1 seen in the ONH region, pointing to possible lack of BRB properties as previously reported. Our data demonstrated that exposure to proton radiation of 0.5 Gy induced oxidative stress-associated apoptosis in the retina and ONH, and changes in BRB integrity in the retina. Our study also revealed the differences in BRB biomarker distribution between these two regions. In response to radiation insults, the cellular response in the retina and ONH may be differentially regulated in acute or hyperfractionated dose schedules.",

The goal of the present study was to characterize changes in the gene expression profiles associated with neuroinflammation, neuronal function, metabolism and stress in mouse brain tissue. Ten-week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on SpaceX-12 for a 35-day mission. Within 38 \u00b1 4 h of splashdown, mice were returned to Earth alive. Brain tissues were collected for analysis. A novel digital color-coded barcode counting technology (NanoStringTM) was used to evaluate gene expression profiles in the spaceflight mouse brain. A set of 54 differently expressed genes (p < 0.05) significantly segregates the habitat ground control (GC) group from flight (FLT) group. Many pathways associated with cellular stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and metabolism were significantly altered by flight conditions. A decrease in the expression of genes important for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin sheath maintenance was observed. Moreover, mRNA expression of many genes related to anti-viral signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and bacterial immune response were significantly downregulated. Here we report that significantly altered immune reactions may be closely associated with spaceflight-induced stress responses and have an impact on the neuronal function.",

We assessed a multi-omics NASA GeneLab dataset where mice were hindlimb unloaded and/or gamma irradiated for 21 days followed by retinal analysis at 7 days, 1 month or 4 months post-exposure. We compared time-matched epigenomic and transcriptomic retinal profiles resulting in a total of 4178 differentially methylated loci or regions, and 457 differentially expressed genes. Highest correlation in methylation difference was seen across different conditions at the same time point. Nucleotide metabolism biological processes were enriched in all groups with activation at 1 month and suppression at 7 days and 4 months. Genes and processes related to Notch and Wnt signaling showed alterations 4 months post-exposure. A total of 23 genes showed significant changes in methylation and expression compared to unexposed controls, including genes involved in retinal function and inflammatory response. This multi-omics analysis interrogates the epigenomic and transcriptomic impacts of radiation and hindlimb unloading on the retina in isolation and in combination and highlights important molecular mechanisms at different post-exposure stages.",

        "Abstract": "The goal of the present study was to characterize acute oxidative damage in ocular structure and retinal function after exposure to spaceflight, and to evaluate the efficacy of an antioxidant in reducing spaceflight-induced changes in the retina. Ten-week-old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS on Space-X 24 over 35 days, and returned to Earth alive. The mice received a weekly injection of a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE), before launch and during their stay onboard the ISS. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical environmental conditions. Before the launch, intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured using a handheld tonometer and retinal function was evaluated using electroretinogram (ERG). ERG signals were recorded when the mouse eye was under dark-adapted conditions in response to ultraviolet monochromatic light flashes. Within 20 h after splashdown, IOP and ERG assessments were repeated before euthanasia. There were significant increases in body weight for habitat control groups post-flight compared to pre-flight measurements. However, the body weights were similar among flight groups before launch and after splashdown. The IOP measurements were similar between pre- and post-flight groups with no significant differences between BuOE-treated and saline controls. Immunofluorescence evaluation showed increases in retinal oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death after spaceflight. BuOE treatment significantly decreased the level of the oxidative stress biomarker. ERG data showed that the average amplitudes of the a- and b-wave were significantly decreased (39% and 32% by spaceflight, respectively) compared to that of habitat ground controls. These data indicate that spaceflight conditions induce oxidative stress in the retina, which may lead to photoreceptor cell damage and retinal function impairment.",

        "Abstract": "Under conditions of weightlessness human position sense appears to deteriorate. This was tested, employing three methods of measurement: two-arm matching, one-arm pointing and one-arm repositioning, carried out during parabolic flight. In hypergravity (1.8G), position sense errors in a matching task increased significantly from the value during horizontal flight (1G) of + 2.5\u00b0 (\u00b1 3.8\u00b0 SD), to + 3.5\u00b0 (\u00b1 3.3\u00b0). For pointing, errors increased significantly from + 9.1\u00b0 (\u00b1 4.4\u00b0) to + 11.2\u00b0 (\u00b1 4.4\u00b0). In microgravity (0G), matching errors fell significantly to + 0.35\u00b0 (\u00b1 3.5\u00b0), while in pointing the fall was not significant. For repositioning, there were no significant changes in errors in either hypergravity or microgravity. It is proposed that the errors in matching and pointing are a consequence of the force of gravity acting at the elbow joint to alter the position signal coming from muscle and joint receptors. For repositioning, memory of the test angle was stored centrally, to be reproduced independently of any changes in gravity.",

        "Abstract": "Summary Widespread generation and analysis of omics data have revolutionized molecular medicine on Earth, yet its power to yield new mechanistic insights and improve occupational health during spaceflight is still to be fully realized in humans. Nevertheless, rapid technological advancements and ever-regular spaceflight programs mean that longitudinal, standardized, and cost-effective collection of human space omics data are firmly within reach. Here, we consider the practicality and scientific return of different sampling methods and omic types in the context of human spaceflight. We also appraise ethical and legal considerations pertinent to omics data derived from European astronauts and spaceflight participants (SFPs). Ultimately, we propose that a routine omics collection program in spaceflight and analog environments presents a golden opportunity. Unlocking this bright future of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven analyses and personalized medicine approaches will require further investigation into best practices, including policy design and standardization of omics data, metadata, and sampling methods.",
        "Conclusion": "Humanity has laid ambitious plans to venture to Mars and establish settlements on other planetary bodies, and commercial spaceflight is gaining rapid traction with the spacefaring population set to quickly increase both in terms of size and diversity. These new endeavors present new challenges for human health in space. Crucially, more data are needed, especially for environmental conditions beyond LEO, where biological and molecular adaptations remain uncharted. Recently the first multiomic profiling studies of astronauts have been performed in the NASA Twins and SpaceX Inspiration4 missions. With their feasibility for spaceflight now demonstrated, these biological big data approaches are primed to transform our understanding of health in space, as they have for health on Earth. Importantly, in addition to elucidating mechanistic understanding of spaceflight-induced physiological deconditioning, these approaches also hold strong potential to improve risk quantification and occupational health in space, such as through the design and deployment of personalized medicine approaches. Thus, routinely applying these same approaches to European human subjects, including participants in analog environments and astronauts and/or SFPs in spaceflight missions, is a golden opportunity. In order to achieve the full potential of these big data approaches, several challenges need to be addressed in a cohesive European fashion. First, how do we best store and ensure collected data are AI ready? Second, which datasets should we collect and when? Third, how do we enable open science approaches while protecting personal data? Although we have introduced the challenges and proposed some options, it is important to achieve European consensus on these questions (Table 1). We propose forming an ESA topical team and/or holding an ESA workshop as a strategic way forward. The goal is to bring together European human omics/data science researchers and human subject researchers to address these questions in coordination with ESA and stakeholders from the commercial spaceflight sector. Importantly, this consensus will need to consider the international context of human research on the ISS, the commercial aspects of data science, and the personal nature of the data. These latter aspects could be achieved via collaboration with organizations, such as International Standards for Space Omics Processing (ISSOP), HRMRB, and TRISH.Table 1Goals and potential topics of discussion for suggested ESA topical team/workshopsGoal: To to explore routine omics collection by deciding which omics data to collect routinely, from which samples, and at which time points.Potential topics to be addressed\u2794 Which omic types and technologies have the highest potential for scientific return and clinical actionability (with additional consideration to multi-omic combinations)?\u2794 Which sample types are the most practical to collect (i.e., cost, sample processing procedures, and invasiveness)?\u2794 What metadata would be the most useful and practical to standardize alongside omics collection (e.g., physiological, environmental, and lifestyle)?\u2794 At which time points should omics be collected?\u2794 How can the AI readiness of the generated datasets be maximized?Goal: To help establish clear ESA policy on human omics research governancePotential topics to be addressed\u2794 What is the potential identifiably of different omic types, in the specific context of astronauts?\u2794 How should ESA go about obtaining meaningful informed consent for omics research?\u2794 Which legal bases should be used for processing astronaut and/or SFP omics data?\u2794 How should ESA handle potential ethical issues, such as incidental findings and discrimination?\u2794 How should data storage and data sharing between ESA\u2019s European and international network be handled?",

        "Abstract": "Spatial omics technologies enable a deeper understanding of cellular organizations and interactions within a tissue of interest. These assays can identify specific compartments or regions in a tissue with differential transcript or protein abundance, delineate their interactions, and complement other methods in defining cellular phenotypes. A variety of spatial methodologies are being developed and commercialized; however, these techniques differ in spatial resolution, multiplexing capability, scale/throughput, and coverage. Here, we review the current and prospective landscape of single cell to subcellular resolution spatial omics technologies and analysis tools to provide a comprehensive picture for both research and clinical applications. Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13059-022-02824-6.",
        "Conclusion": "As spatial omics technologies mature and provide a deeper understanding of the cellular states and functions, spatial epigenomics, metagenomics, and metabolomics will also reveal a great number of biological insights that complement the transcript-level findings. Integration strategies across different molecular classes (for example, integrating metabolomics data with proteomic, transcriptomic, or genomic data) would also be needed. Development of appropriate analysis packages that offers end-to-end solutions for each technology, as well as compatibility with orthogonal platforms is also crucial to increase the usage and application of these technologies. In summary, the spatial omics field has blossomed and radically increased the breadth and resolution of in situ experiments in the past few years. These technologies can now boast detection of more than 10,000 unique gene targets with 50\u2013100 nm spatial resolution. Developments in probe chemistry, image acquisition, and commercialization are driving down costs, transforming spatial omics technologies into a commonplace technique available to all labs, similar to NGS in the 2010s and microarrays in the early 2000s. This unparalleled depth and richness of data leading to spatially intact single cell profiles promises to fuel new discoveries for infectious disease, tumor oncology, and basic science applications like cell signaling, migration, and spatiotemporal-delineated functions. Efforts to introduce three-dimensional, deep-slide scanning, and time series data collection will also continue to propel the field even further in the coming years, revealing novel cellular architectures and entirely new domains of biology.",

        "Abstract": "During the construction and assembly of the Mars 2020 mission components at two different NASA cleanrooms, several fungal strains were isolated. Based on their colony morphology, two strains that showed yeast-like appearance were further characterized for their phylogenetic position. The species-level classification of these two novel strains, using traditional colony and cell morphology methods combined with the phylogenetic reconstructions using multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) based on several gene loci (ITS, LSU, SSU, RPB1, RPB2, CYTB and TEF1), and whole genome sequencing (WGS) was carried out. This polyphasic taxonomic approach supported the conclusion that the two basidiomycetous yeasts belong to hitherto undescribed species. The strain FJI-L2-BK-P3T, isolated from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Spacecraft Assembly Facility, was placed in the Naganishia albida clade (Filobasidiales, Tremellomycetes), but is genetically and physiologically different from other members of the clade. Another yeast strain FKI-L6-BK-PAB1T, isolated from the Kennedy Space Center Payload Hazardous and Servicing Facility, was placed in the genus Cystobasidium (Cystobasidiales, Cystobasidiomycetes) and is distantly related to C. benthicum. Here we propose two novel species with the type strains, Naganishia kalamii sp. nov. (FJI-L2-BK-P3T = NRRL 64466 = DSM 115730) and Cystobasidium onofrii sp. nov. (FKI-L6-BK-PAB1T = NRRL 64426 = DSM 114625). The phylogenetic analyses revealed that single gene phylogenies (ITS or LSU) were not conclusive, and MLSA and WGS-based phylogenies were more advantageous for species discrimination in the two genera. The genomic analysis predicted proteins associated with dehydration and desiccation stress-response and the presence of genes that are directly related to osmotolerance and psychrotolerance in both novel yeasts described. Cells of these two newly-described yeasts were exposed to UV-C radiation and compared with N. onofrii, an extremophilic UV-C resistant cold-adapted Alpine yeast. Both novel species were UV resistant, emphasizing the need for collecting and characterizing extremotolerant microbes, including yeasts, to improve microbial reduction techniques used in NASA planetary protection programs. Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s43008-023-00119-4.",
        "Conclusion": "This study underscores the extreme, oligotrophic conditions of meticulously maintained NASA cleanrooms, which could potentially house various microbes, including significant yeast species. Traditional yeast identification methods are deemed inadequate, highlighting the need for more precise techniques like MLSA and WGS, particularly for complex genera like Naganishia. The study also warns about these UV-C resistant yeasts, including high-altitude, cold-adapted N. onofrii and two other NASA cleanroom species, to potentially contaminate extraterrestrial environments, thereby posing risks to life-detection missions. The presence of these cold-adapted yeasts in SAF bears implications for future missions to icy moons. Genomic analysis further reveals the potential for survival in harsh conditions, pointing to genes linked with desiccation tolerance and UV resistance.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract BackgroundThe Inspiration4 (I4) mission, the first all-civilian orbital flight mission, investigated the physiological effects of short-duration spaceflight through a multi-omic approach. Despite advances, there remains much to learn about human adaptation to spaceflight's unique challenges, including microgravity, immune system perturbations, and radiation exposure. MethodsTo provide a detailed genetics analysis of the mission, we collected dried blood spots pre-, during, and post-flight for DNA extraction. Telomere length was measured by quantitative PCR, while whole genome and cfDNA sequencing provided insight into genomic stability and immune adaptations. A robust bioinformatic pipeline was used for data analysis, including variant calling to assess mutational burden. ResultTelomere elongation occurred during spaceflight and shortened after return to Earth. Cell-free DNA analysis revealed increased immune cell signatures post-flight. No significant clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) or whole-genome instability was observed. The long-term gene expression changes across immune cells suggested cellular adaptations to the space environment persisting months post-flight. ConclusionOur findings provide valuable insights into the physiological consequences of short-duration spaceflight, with telomere dynamics and immune cell gene expression adapting to spaceflight and persisting after return to Earth. CHIP sequencing data will serve as a reference point for studying the early development of CHIP in astronauts, an understudied phenomenon as previous studies have focused on career astronauts. This study will serve as a reference point for future commercial and non-commercial spaceflight, low Earth orbit (LEO) missions, and deep-space exploration.",

The NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) provides transparent and FAIR access to biological studies, notably the SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission, which amassed extensive data from civilian astronauts. This dataset encompasses omics and clinical assays, facilitating comprehensive research on space-induced biological responses. These data allow for multi-modal, longitudinal assessments, bridging the gap between human and model organism studies. Crucially, community-driven data standards established by NASA\u2019s OSDR Analysis Working Groups empower artificial intelligence and machine learning to glean invaluable insights, guiding future mission planning and health risk mitigation. This article presents a concise guide to access and analyze I4 data in OSDR, including programmatic access through GLOpenAPI. This pioneering effort establishes a precedent for post-mission health monitoring programs within space agencies, propelling research in the burgeoning field of commercial space travel\u2019s impact on human physiology.",

        "Abstract": "Human spaceflight has historically been managed by government agencies, such as in the NASA Twins Study1, but new commercial spaceflight opportunities have opened spaceflight to a broader population. In 2021, the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission launched the first all-civilian crew to low Earth orbit, which included the youngest American astronaut (aged 29), new in-flight experimental technologies (handheld ultrasound imaging, smartwatch wearables and immune profiling), ocular alignment measurements and new protocols for in-depth, multi-omic molecular and cellular profiling. Here we report the primary findings from the 3-day spaceflight mission, which induced a broad range of physiological and stress responses, neurovestibular changes indexed by ocular misalignment, and altered neurocognitive functioning, some of which match those of long-term spaceflight2, but almost all of which did not differ from baseline (pre-flight) after return to Earth. Overall, these preliminary civilian spaceflight data suggest that short-duration missions do not pose a significant health risk, and moreover present a rich opportunity to measure the earliest phases of adaptation to spaceflight in the human body at anatomical, cellular, physiological and cognitive levels. Finally, these methods and results lay the foundation for an open, rapidly expanding biomedical database for astronauts3, which can inform countermeasure development for both private and government-sponsored space missions.",
        "Conclusion": "While broad in its research scope, this study represents only the beginning. Anatomical and physiological variability, small sample size, the operational complexities of a highly constrained mission and limited skill management capabilities combined to preclude confident conclusions on many physiological variables. However, as intended by the TRISH, enhancing exploration platforms and analog definition, and SOMA programmes, these Inspiration4 data will serve as a rich foundation for scaling and enhancing the knowledge base on early phases of space physiology, and expanding our understanding of spaceflight-associated effects on human health. Future missions can also include telemedicine, more autonomous data collection, next-generation sequencing-based in-flight omics assays and related diagnostics tools. Excitingly, some of these same astronauts will be present on future missions and/or contribute to long-term studies of astronaut health, which will help delineate the short- and long-term impacts of spaceflight and continue to prepare future astronauts for their missions. Finally, it is worth noting that collaboration with government, academia and the private sector at the same time led to lessons learned that should be useful to investigators embarking on similar endeavours in future civilian spaceflight missions. Specifically, co-ordination among diverse research teams can be enabled by agile funding entities (for example, TRISH, SpaceX, philanthropy) and a dedicated project manager. Also, a single institutional review board (IRB) protocol, such as that put in place by TRISH, can simplify subject consenting, while a standardized database provider (TrialX, funded by TRISH) was critical for data ingestion, cross-institute sharing and standardization for future cross-mission analyses and use of artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches. Finally, the consent and release forms of study participants were envisioned for long-term use, with datasets managed under the oversight of a data release board, and for these precious samples to be utilized and characterized for many years to come.",

        "Abstract": "Telomeres are repetitive nucleoprotein complexes at chromosomal termini essential for maintaining genome stability. Telomeric RNA, or TERRA, is a previously presumed long noncoding RNA of heterogeneous lengths that contributes to end-capping structure and function, and facilitates telomeric recombination in tumors that maintain telomere length via the telomerase-independent Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) pathway. Here, we investigated TERRA in the radiation-induced DNA damage response (DDR) across astronauts, high-altitude climbers, healthy donors, and cellular models. Similar to astronauts in the space radiation environment and climbers of Mt. Everest, in vitro radiation exposure prompted increased transcription of TERRA, while simulated microgravity did not. Data suggest a specific TERRA DDR to telomeric double-strand breaks (DSBs), and provide direct demonstration of hybridized TERRA at telomere-specific DSB sites, indicative of protective TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrid formation. Targeted telomeric DSBs also resulted in accumulation of TERRA foci in G2-phase, supportive of TERRA\u2019s role in facilitating recombination-mediated telomere elongation. Results have important implications for scenarios involving persistent telomeric DNA damage, such as those associated with chronic oxidative stress (e.g., aging, systemic inflammation, environmental and occupational radiation exposures), which can trigger transient ALT in normal human cells, as well as for targeting TERRA as a therapeutic strategy against ALT-positive tumors.",

To investigate the impact of short-duration spaceflight on the skin, we conducted skin biopsies on the Inspiration4 crew members before (L-44) and after (R + 1) flight. Leveraging multi-omics assays including GeoMx\u2122 Digital Spatial Profiler, single-cell RNA/ATAC-seq, and metagenomics/metatranscriptomics, we assessed spatial gene expressions and associated microbial and immune changes across 95 skin regions in four compartments: outer epidermis, inner epidermis, outer dermis, and vasculature. Post-flight samples showed significant up-regulation of genes related to inflammation and KRAS signaling across all skin regions. These spaceflight-associated changes mapped to specific cellular responses, including altered interferon responses, DNA damage, epithelial barrier disruptions, T-cell migration, and hindered regeneration were located primarily in outer tissue compartments. We also linked epithelial disruption to microbial shifts in skin swab and immune cell activity to PBMC single-cell data from the same crew and timepoints. Our findings present the inaugural collection and examination of astronaut skin, offering insights for future space missions and response countermeasures.",

        "Abstract": "Maintenance of astronaut health during spaceflight will require monitoring and potentially modulating their microbiomes. However, documenting microbial shifts during spaceflight has been difficult due to mission constraints that lead to limited sampling and profiling. Here we executed a six-month longitudinal study to quantify the high-resolution human microbiome response to three days in orbit for four individuals. Using paired metagenomics and metatranscriptomics alongside single-nuclei immune cell profiling, we characterized time-dependent, multikingdom microbiome changes across 750 samples and 10 body sites before, during and after spaceflight at eight timepoints. We found that most alterations were transient across body sites; for example, viruses increased in skin sites mostly during flight. However, longer-term shifts were observed in the oral microbiome, including increased plaque-associated bacteria (for example, Fusobacteriota), which correlated with immune cell gene expression. Further, microbial genes associated with phage activity, toxin\u2013antitoxin systems and stress response were enriched across multiple body sites. In total, this study reveals in-depth characterization of microbiome and immune response shifts experienced by astronauts during short-term spaceflight and the associated changes to the living environment, which can help guide future missions, spacecraft design and space habitat planning.",

        "Abstract": "It is now widely recognised that the environment in space activates a diverse set of genes involved in regulating fundamental cellular pathways. This includes the activation of genes associated with blood homeostasis and erythropoiesis, with a particular emphasis on those involved in globin chain production. Haemoglobin biology provides an intriguing model for studying space omics, as it has been extensively explored at multiple -omic levels, spanning DNA, RNA, and protein analyses, in both experimental and clinical contexts. In this study, we examined the developmental expression of haemoglobin over time and space using a unique suite of multi-omic datasets available on NASA GeneLab, from the NASA Twins Study, the JAXA CFE study, and the Inspiration4 mission. Our findings reveal significant variations in globin gene expression corresponding to the distinct spatiotemporal characteristics of the collected samples. This study sheds light on the dynamic nature of globin gene regulation in response to the space environment and provides valuable insights into the broader implications of space omics research.",

To better characterize this effect, we generated single-cell, multi-ome, cell-free RNA (cfRNA), biochemical, and hematology data for the SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission crew. We found that 18 cytokines/chemokines related to inflammation, aging, and muscle homeostasis changed after spaceflight. In I4 single-cell multi-omics data, we identified a \u201cspaceflight signature\u201d of gene expression characterized by enrichment in oxidative phosphorylation, UV response, immune function, and TCF21 pathways. We confirmed the presence of this signature in independent datasets, including the NASA Twins Study, the I4 skin spatial transcriptomics, and 817 NASA GeneLab mouse transcriptomes. Finally, we observed that (1) T cells showed an up-regulation of FOXP3, (2) MHC class I genes exhibited long-term suppression, and (3) infection-related immune pathways were associated with microbiome shifts. In summary, this study reveals conserved and distinct immune disruptions occurring and details a roadmap for potential countermeasures to preserve astronaut health.",

        "Abstract": "Microgravity is associated with immunological dysfunction, though the mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, using single-cell analysis of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exposed to short term (25 hours) simulated microgravity, we characterize altered genes and pathways at basal and stimulated states with a Toll-like Receptor-7/8 agonist. We validate single-cell analysis by RNA sequencing and super-resolution microscopy, and against data from the Inspiration-4 (I4) mission, JAXA (Cell-Free Epigenome) mission, Twins study, and spleens from mice on the International Space Station. Overall, microgravity alters specific pathways for optimal immunity, including the cytoskeleton, interferon signaling, pyroptosis, temperature-shock, innate inflammation (e.g., Coronavirus pathogenesis pathway and IL-6 signaling), nuclear receptors, and sirtuin signaling. Microgravity directs monocyte inflammatory parameters, and impairs T cell and NK cell functionality. Using machine learning, we identify numerous compounds linking microgravity to immune cell transcription, and demonstrate that the flavonol, quercetin, can reverse most abnormal pathways. These results define immune cell alterations in microgravity, and provide opportunities for countermeasures to maintain normal immunity in space.",

Yet current frameworks for aerospace medicine are nascent and lag far behind advancements in precision medicine on Earth, underscoring the need for rapid development of space medicine databases, tools and protocols. Here we present the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA), an integrated data and sample repository for clinical, cellular and multi-omic research profiles from a diverse range of missions, including the NASA Twins Study7, JAXA CFE study8,9, SpaceX Inspiration4 crew10\u201312, Axiom and Polaris. The SOMA resource represents a more than tenfold increase in publicly available human space omics data, with matched samples available from the Cornell Aerospace Medicine Biobank. The Atlas includes extensive molecular and physiological profiles encompassing genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and microbiome datasets, which reveal some consistent features across missions, including cytokine shifts, telomere elongation and gene expression changes, as well as mission-specific molecular responses and links to orthologous, tissue-specific mouse datasets. Leveraging the datasets, tools and resources in SOMA can help to accelerate precision aerospace medicine, bringing needed health monitoring, risk mitigation and countermeasure data for upcoming lunar, Mars and exploration-class missions.",

        "Abstract": "As spaceflight becomes more common with commercial crews, blood-based measures of crew health can guide both astronaut biomedicine and countermeasures. By profiling plasma proteins, metabolites, and extracellular vesicles/particles (EVPs) from the SpaceX Inspiration4 crew, we generated \u201cspaceflight secretome profiles,\u201d which showed significant differences in coagulation, oxidative stress, and brain-enriched proteins. While >93% of differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in vesicles and metabolites recovered within six months, the majority (73%) of plasma DAPs were still perturbed post-flight. Moreover, these proteomic alterations correlated better with peripheral blood mononuclear cells than whole blood, suggesting that immune cells contribute more DAPs than erythrocytes. Finally, to discern possible mechanisms leading to brain-enriched protein detection and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, we examined protein changes in dissected brains of spaceflight mice, which showed increases in PECAM-1, a marker of BBB integrity. These data highlight how even short-duration spaceflight can disrupt human and murine physiology and identify spaceflight biomarkers that can guide countermeasure development.",

        "Abstract": "Future multi-year crewed planetary missions will motivate advances in aerospace nutrition and telehealth. On Earth, the Human Cell Atlas project aims to spatially map all cell types in the human body. Here, we propose that a parallel Human Cell Space Atlas could serve as an openly available, global resource for space life science research. As humanity becomes increasingly spacefaring, high-resolution omics on orbit could permit an advent of precision spaceflight healthcare. Alongside the scientific potential, we consider the complex ethical, cultural, and legal challenges intrinsic to the human space omics discipline, and how philosophical frameworks may benefit from international perspectives.",
        "Conclusion": "In the coming years, humans may venture into space for unprecedented durations and distances outside of the Earth\u2019s radioprotective magnetosphere. Resupply and evacuation would be precluded in some cases, calling for a modernized spaceflight nutrition, wellness, and telehealth field that would likely incorporate molecular omics. Precision healthcare is becoming more commonplace for populations on Earth, where international consortiums are using high-resolution omics to construct the Human Cell Atlas. It seems probable that as increasingly large and diverse populations enter space, the purposeful implementation of routine standardized omics with consenting participants during spaceflight could similarly permit precision space healthcare and a Human Cell Space Atlas. The cell space atlas could serve as an open access, global reference for basic space life science research. While human space omics could catalyze critical improvement of safety measures for future space travelers, numerous ethical, cultural, and legal challenges would need to be carefully surmounted from global viewpoints. This manuscript provided examples of both the potential healthcare benefits and the ethical complexities that will likely be inherent to the human space omics discipline as a means to encourage anticipatory discussions amongst international ethicists, philosophers, scientists, and the public community.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundSpaceflight poses a unique set of challenges to humans and the hostile spaceflight environment can induce a wide range of increased health risks, including dermatological issues. The biology driving the frequency of skin issues in astronauts is currently not well understood. MethodsTo address this issue, we used a systems biology approach utilizing NASA\u2019s Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) on space flown murine transcriptomic datasets focused on the skin, biochemical profiles of 50 NASA astronauts and human transcriptomic datasets generated from blood and hair samples of JAXA astronauts, as well as blood samples obtained from the NASA Twins Study, and skin and blood samples from the first civilian commercial mission, Inspiration4. ResultsKey biological changes related to skin health, DNA damage & repair, and mitochondrial dysregulation are identified as potential drivers for skin health risks during spaceflight. Additionally, a machine learning model is utilized to determine gene pairings associated with spaceflight response in the skin. While we identified spaceflight-induced dysregulation, such as alterations in genes associated with skin barrier function and collagen formation, our results also highlight the remarkable ability for organisms to re-adapt back to Earth via post-flight re-tuning of gene expression. ConclusionOur findings can guide future research on developing countermeasures for mitigating spaceflight-associated skin damage.",

We performed biomolecular (epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, epiproteomic, metabolomic, metagenomic), clinical chemistry (electrolytes, endocrinology, biochemistry) and morphometry (histology, 3D imaging, miRNA-ISH, tissue weights) analyses using samples and datasets available from 11 spaceflight-exposed mouse and 5 human, 1 simulated microgravity rat and 4 simulated GCR-exposed mouse missions. We found that spaceflight induces: 1) renal transporter dephosphorylation which may indicate astronauts\u2019 increased risk of nephrolithiasis is in part a primary renal phenomenon rather than solely a secondary consequence of bone loss; 2) remodelling of the nephron that results in expansion of distal convoluted tubule size but loss of overall tubule density; 3) renal damage and dysfunction when exposed to a Mars roundtrip dose-equivalent of simulated GCR.",

        "Abstract": "Organismal adaptations to spaceflight have been characterized at the molecular level in model organisms, including Drosophila and C. elegans. Here, we extend molecular work to energy metabolism and sex hormone signaling in mice and humans. We found spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen signaling in rodents and humans. Murine changes were most prominent in the liver, where we observed inhibition of insulin and estrogen receptor signaling with concomitant hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis. Based on the metabolic demand, metabolic pathways mediated by insulin and estrogen vary among muscles, specifically between the soleus and extensor digitorum longus. In humans, spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen related genes and pathways. Pathway analysis demonstrated spaceflight induced changes in insulin resistance, estrogen signaling, stress response, and viral infection. These data strongly suggest the need for further research on the metabolic and reproductive endocrinologic effects of space travel, if we are to become a successful interplanetary species.",

        "Abstract": "Planning long-term space flights necessarily includes issues of providing food for the crew. One of the areas of research is the development of technologies for independent production of food by the crew. Extensive research on lettuce has confirmed that the \u201cspace production\u201d of lettuce is not inferior to that on Earth, even in the absence of gravity, but the same deep understanding of the quality of grain crops has not yet been achieved. Therefore, the goal of our work is to establish whether the conditions for growing wheat in outer space without gravity affect the weight and basic parameters of the grain, and whether this leads to increased asymmetry of the kernel and distortion of the starch composition. The objects of the study were wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) kernels of the Super Dwarf cultivar. Of which, 100 kernels matured in outer space conditions in the Lada growth chamber on the International Space Station (ISS), and 85 kernels of the control wheat grown in a similar growth chamber under terrestrial conditions. It has been established that kernels from ISS have significant differences to a smaller extent in weight, area, length, and width of the kernel. However, the kernels under both conditions were predominantly large (the average weight of a kernel in space is 0.0362 g, and in terrestrial conditions\u20140.0376 g). The hypothesis that the level of fluctuating asymmetry will increase in outer space was not confirmed; significant differences between the options were not proven. In general, the kernels are fairly even (coefficients of variation for the main parameters of the kernel are within 6\u201312%) and with a low or very low level of asymmetry. The length of starch granules of type A in filled and puny kernels is significantly greater in kernels from ISS than in the control, and in terms of the width of starch granules B and roundness indices, both experimental variants are the same. It can be assumed that the baking qualities of earthly kernels will be slightly higher, since the ratio of type B starch granules to type A is 5\u20138% higher than on the ISS. Also, the width of the aleurone layer cells in mature kernels was significantly inferior to the result obtained on Earth. The work proposes a new method for establishing the asymmetry of kernels without a traumatic effect (in early works, it was supposed to study asymmetry in transverse sections of the kernels). Perhaps this will make it possible to further develop a computer scanning program that will determine the level of asymmetry of the wheat fruit.",

        "Abstract": "The ability to grow safe, fresh food to supplement packaged foods of astronauts in space has been an important goal for NASA. Food crops grown in space experience different environmental conditions than plants grown on Earth (e.g., reduced gravity, elevated radiation levels). To study the effects of space conditions, red romaine lettuce, Lactuca sativa cv \u2018Outredgeous,\u2019 plants were grown in Veggie plant growth chambers on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared with ground-grown plants. Multiple plantings were grown on ISS and harvested using either a single, final harvest, or sequential harvests in which several mature leaves were removed from the plants at weekly intervals. Ground controls were grown simultaneously with a 24\u201372 h delay using ISS environmental data. Food safety of the plants was determined by heterotrophic plate counts for bacteria and fungi, as well as isolate identification using samples taken from the leaves and roots. Molecular characterization was conducted using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to provide taxonomic composition and phylogenetic structure of the community. Leaves were also analyzed for elemental composition, as well as levels of phenolics, anthocyanins, and Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC). Comparison of flight and ground tissues showed some differences in total counts for bacteria and yeast/molds (2.14 \u2013 4.86 log10 CFU/g), while screening for select human pathogens yielded negative results. Bacterial and fungal isolate identification and community characterization indicated variation in the diversity of genera between leaf and root tissue with diversity being higher in root tissue, and included differences in the dominant genera. The only difference between ground and flight experiments was seen in the third experiment, VEG-03A, with significant differences in the genera from leaf tissue. Flight and ground tissue showed differences in Fe, K, Na, P, S, and Zn content and total phenolic levels, but no differences in anthocyanin and ORAC levels. This study indicated that leafy vegetable crops can produce safe, edible, fresh food to supplement to the astronauts\u2019 diet, and provide baseline data for continual operation of the Veggie plant growth units on ISS.",

        "Abstract": "We evaluated the effect of AsiMax 50\u00ae, a commercial formulation of 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), on the structure of both micro + nano phytoplankton (>2 \u03bcm; species composition and abundance) and cytometric populations (photosynthetic picoplankton (PPP, 0.2\u20132 \u03bcm), which included prokaryotic phycocyanin-rich picocyanobacteria (PC-Pcy), phycoerythrin-rich picocyanobacteria (PE-Pcy) and eukaryotic phototrophs (PEuk); and bacterioplankton (HB), heterotrophic bacteria), using a microcosms-based approach and a single 7-day exposure. Assays were performed on two different microbial assemblages sampled from freshwater bodies of two contrasting turbidity status: clear (chlorophyll a = 7.6 \u03bcgL-1, turbidity = 1 NTU) and organic turbid systems (chlorophyll a = 25.0 \u03bcgL-1, turbidity = 9 NTU). For each system, the herbicide was applied to 500 mL-Erlenmeyer flasks, at seven concentration levels of the active ingredient (a.i.): 0 (control = no addition), 0.02, 0.2, 2, 20, 200 and 2,000 mg a.i.L\u22121. The impact of AsiMax 50\u00ae seemed to be greater in the turbid system. In this system, total abundance of living (live) micro + nano phytoplankton showed a significant increase at lower concentrations and data were fitted to a humped-shaped curve. For both clear and organic turbid systems, micro + nano phytoplankton decreased in species richness and abundance at higher herbicide concentrations. These results suggest that 2,4-D may mimic hormonal function. Some species, such as Ochromonas sp. and Chlamydomonas sp., showed different responses to herbicide exposure between water systems. In the turbid system, the increase in abundance of the PPP fraction observed at 7-d exposure was probably due to either an increase in PE-Pcy (thus suggesting the existence of auxin pathways) or a reduction in competitive pressure by micro + nano plankton. Our results provide some evidence of the importance of using community-scale approaches in ecotoxicological studies to predict changes in freshwater ecosystems exposed to a 2,4-D-based formulation. However, caution must be taken when extrapolating these effects to real scenarios, as assays were based on a laboratory microcosm experiment.",

Here, we isolate a rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponics but normal gravitropic growth in soil. We identify COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (CRW1) encoding an ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)-BINDING F-BOX PROTEIN (OsEBF1) as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype. We show that the OsCRW1-EIN3 LIKE 1 and 2 (OsEIL1/2)-ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 82 (OsERF82) module controls the production of reactive oxygen species in the root tip, subsequently impacting root cap stability, polar localization of PIN-FORMED 2 (OsPIN2), symmetric distribution of auxin, and ultimately gravitropic growth of roots. The OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 ethylene signaling module is effectively impeded by applying gentle mechanical resistance to root tips, including growing in water-saturated paddy soil. We further show that mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling is required and sufficient for antagonizing the ethylene signaling pathway. This study has revealed previously unanticipated interplay among ethylene, auxin, and mechanosensing in the control of plant gravitropism.",

However, the molecular mechanisms that govern the regulation of root growth by cadaverine are largely unexplored. Here we conducted a forward genetic screen and isolated a mutation, cadaverine hypersensitive 3 (cdh3), which resulted in increased root\u2010growth sensitivity to cadaverine, but not other polyamines. This mutation affects the BIO3\u2010BIO1 biotin biosynthesis gene. Exogenous supply of biotin and a pathway intermediate downstream of BIO1, 7,8\u2010diaminopelargonic acid, suppressed this cadaverine sensitivity phenotype. An in vitro enzyme assay showed cadaverine inhibits the BIO3\u2010BIO1 activity. Furthermore, cadaverine\u2010treated seedlings displayed reduced biotinylation of Biotin Carboxyl Carrier Protein 1 of the acetyl\u2010coenzyme A carboxylase complex involved in de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, resulting in decreased accumulation of triacylglycerides. Taken together, these results revealed an unexpected role of cadaverine in the regulation of biotin biosynthesis, which leads to modulation of primary root growth of plants.",

        "Abstract": "Clinostats are instruments that continuously rotate biological specimens along an axis, thereby averaging their orientation relative to gravity over time. Our previous experiments indicated that low-speed clinorotation may itself trigger directional root tip curvature. In this project, we have investigated the root curvature response to low-speed clinorotation using Arabidopsis thaliana and Brachypodium distachyon seedlings as models. We show that low-speed clinorotation triggers root tip curvature in which direction is dictated by gravitropism during the first half-turn of clinorotation. We also show that the angle of root tip curvature is modulated by the speed of clinorotation. Arabidopsis mutations affecting gravity susception (pgm) or gravity signal transduction (arg1, toc132) are shown to affect the root tip curvature response to low-speed clinorotation. Furthermore, low-speed vertical clinorotation triggers relocalization of the PIN3 auxin efflux facilitator to the lateral membrane of Arabidopsis root cap statocytes, and creates a lateral gradient of auxin across the root tip. Together, these observations support a role for gravitropism in modulating root curvature responses to clinorotation. Interestingly, distinct Brachypodium distachyon accessions display different abilities to develop root tip curvature responses to low-speed vertical clinorotation, suggesting the possibility of using genome-wide association studies to further investigate this process.",

While rapid screening methods for microtiter plate well (\u201cstatic\u201d) biofilms are available, there are no methods for such screening of continuous flow biofilms (\u201cflow biofilms\u201d). Since the latter biofilms more closely approximate natural biofilms, development of a high-throughput (HTP) method for screening them is desirable. We describe here a new method using a device comprised of microfluidic channels and a distributed pneumatic pump (BioFlux) that provides fluid flow to 96 individual biofilms. This device allows fine control of continuous or intermittent fluid flow over a broad range of flow rates, and the use of a standard well plate format provides compatibility with plate readers. We show that use of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing bacteria, staining with propidium iodide, and measurement of fluorescence with a plate reader permit rapid and accurate determination of biofilm viability. The biofilm viability measured with the plate reader agreed with that determined using plate counts, as well as with the results of fluorescence microscope image analysis. Using BioFlux and the plate reader, we were able to rapidly screen the effects of several antimicrobials on the viability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 flow biofilms.",

        "Abstract": "Stationary-phase bacteria are important in disease. The \u03c3s-regulated general stress response helps them become resistant to disinfectants, but the role of \u03c3s in bacterial antibiotic resistance has not been elucidated. Loss of \u03c3s rendered stationary-phase Escherichia coli more sensitive to the bactericidal antibiotic gentamicin (Gm), and proteomic analysis suggested involvement of a weakened antioxidant defense. Use of the psfiA genetic reporter, 3\u2032-(p-hydroxyphenyl) fluorescein (HPF) dye, and Amplex Red showed that Gm generated more reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mutant. HPF measurements can be distorted by cell elongation, but Gm did not affect stationary-phase cell dimensions. Coadministration of the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) decreased drug lethality particularly in the mutant, as did Gm treatment under anaerobic conditions that prevent ROS formation. Greater oxidative stress, due to insufficient quenching of endogenous ROS and/or respiration-linked electron leakage, therefore contributed to the greater sensitivity of the mutant; infection by a uropathogenic strain in mice showed this to be the case also in vivo. Disruption of antioxidant defense by eliminating the quencher proteins, SodA/SodB and KatE/SodA, or the pentose phosphate pathway proteins, Zwf/Gnd and TalA, which provide NADPH for ROS decomposition, also generated greater oxidative stress and killing by Gm. Thus, besides its established mode of action, Gm also kills stationary-phase bacteria by generating oxidative stress, and targeting the antioxidant defense of E. coli can enhance its efficacy. Relevant aspects of the current controversy on the role of ROS in killing by bactericidal drugs of exponential-phase bacteria, which represent a different physiological state, are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Mammalian cells employ an array of biological mechanisms to detect and respond to mechanical loading in their environment. One such mechanism is the formation of plasma membrane disruptions (PMD), which foster a molecular flux across cell membranes that promotes tissue adaptation. Repair of PMD through an orchestrated activity of molecular machinery is critical for cell survival, and the rate of PMD repair can affect downstream cellular signaling. PMD have been observed to influence the mechanical behavior of skin, alveolar, and gut epithelial cells, aortic endothelial cells, corneal keratocytes and epithelial cells, cardiac and skeletal muscle myocytes, neurons, and most recently, bone cells including osteoblasts, periodontal ligament cells, and osteocytes. PMD are therefore positioned to affect the physiological behavior of a wide range of vertebrate organ systems including skeletal and cardiac muscle, skin, eyes, the gastrointestinal tract, the vasculature, the respiratory system, and the skeleton. The purpose of this review is to describe the processes of PMD formation and repair across these mechanosensitive tissues, with a particular emphasis on comparing and contrasting repair mechanisms and downstream signaling to better understand the role of PMD in skeletal mechanobiology. The implications of PMD-related mechanisms for disease and potential therapeutic applications are also explored.",

Design:Tissues from female mice flown on the US space shuttle missions Space Transportation System (STS)-131 and STS-135 for 15 and 13 d, respectively, and from male mice flown on the 30 d Russian Bion-M1 biosatellite, were examined using transmission electron microscopy and light and electron microscopic immunohistochemistry. Results:In contrast to the parotid gland, morphologic changes were not apparent in the submandibular gland. No significant changes in protein expression, as assessed by quantitative immunogold labeling, occurred in female mice flown for 13-15 d. In male mice, however, increased labeling for salivary androgen binding protein alpha (in acinar cell secretory granules), and epidermal growth factor and nerve growth factor (in granular convoluted duct cell granules) was seen after 30 d in space. Conclusion:These results indicate that spaceflight alters secretory protein expression in the submandibular gland and suggest that the sex of the animals and the length of the flight may affect the response. These findings also show that individual salivary glands respond differently to spaceflight. Saliva contains proteins secreted from salivary glands and is easily collected, therefore is a useful biofluid for general medical analyses and in particular for monitoring the physiology and health of astronauts.",

Design:Tissues from female mice flown on the US space shuttle missions Space Transportation System (STS)-131 and STS-135 for 15 and 13 d, respectively, and from male mice flown on the 30 d Russian Bion-M1 biosatellite, were examined using transmission electron microscopy and light and electron microscopic immunohistochemistry. Results:In contrast to the parotid gland, morphologic changes were not apparent in the submandibular gland. No significant changes in protein expression, as assessed by quantitative immunogold labeling, occurred in female mice flown for 13-15 d. In male mice, however, increased labeling for salivary androgen binding protein alpha (in acinar cell secretory granules), and epidermal growth factor and nerve growth factor (in granular convoluted duct cell granules) was seen after 30 d in space. Conclusion:These results indicate that spaceflight alters secretory protein expression in the submandibular gland and suggest that the sex of the animals and the length of the flight may affect the response. These findings also show that individual salivary glands respond differently to spaceflight. Saliva contains proteins secreted from salivary glands and is easily collected, therefore is a useful biofluid for general medical analyses and in particular for monitoring the physiology and health of astronauts.",

        "Abstract": "The ultrastructure and immunohistochemistry of secretory proteins of sublingual glands were studied in mice flown on the US space shuttles Discovery (Space Transportation System [STS]-131) and Atlantis (STS-135). No differences in mucous acinar or serous demilune cell structure were observed between sublingual glands of ground control and flight mice. In contrast, previous studies showed autophagy and apoptosis of parotid serous acinar cells in flight mice. The expression of parotid secretory protein (PSP) in sublingual demilune cells of STS-131 flight mice was significantly increased compared to ground control mice but decreased in STS-135 flight mice. Similarly, mucin (Muc19) expression in acinar cells and PKA-RII expression in demilune cells were increased in STS-131 flight mice and decreased in STS-135 flight mice, but not significantly. Demilune cell and parotid protein (DCPP) was slightly decreased in mice from both flights, and nuclear PKA-RII was slightly increased. These results indicate that the response of salivary glands to spaceflight conditions varies among the different glands, cell types and secretory proteins. Additionally, the spaceflight environment, including the effects of microgravity, modifies protein expression. Determining changes in salivary proteins may lead to development of non-invasive methods to assess the physiological status of astronauts.",

        "Abstract": "Introduction: Space is a unique environment characterized by isolation from community life and exposure to circadian misalignment, microgravity, and space radiation. These multiple differences from those experienced on the earth may cause systemic and local tissue stress. Autonomic nerves, including sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, regulate functions in multiple organs. Saliva is secreted from the salivary gland, which is regulated by autonomic nerves, and plays several important roles in the oral cavity and digestive processes. The balance of the autonomic nervous system in the seromucous glands, such as the submandibular glands, precisely controls serous and mucous saliva. Psychological stress, radiation damage, and other triggers can cause an imbalance in salivary secretion systems. A previous study reported that amylase is a stress marker in behavioral medicine and space flight crews; however, the detailed mechanisms underlying amylase regulation in the space environment are still unknown. Methods: In this study, we aimed to elucidate how lunar gravity (1/6 g) changes mRNA expression patterns in the salivary gland. Using a multiple artificial gravity research system during space flight in the International Space Station, we studied the effects of two different gravitational levels, lunar and Earth gravity, on the submandibular glands of mice. All mice survived, returned to Earth from space, and their submandibular glands were collected 2 days after landing. Results: We found that lunar gravity induced the expression of the salivary amylase gene Amy1; however, no increase in Aqp5 and Ano1, which regulate water secretion, was observed. In addition, genes involved in the exocrine system, such as vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 (Vamp8) and small G proteins, including Rap1 and Rab families, were upregulated under lunar gravity. Conclusion: These results imply that lunar gravity upregulates salivary amylase secretion via Rap/Rab signaling and exocytosis via Vamp8. Our study highlights Amy1 as a potential candidate marker for stress regulation in salivary glands in the lunar gravity environment.",

        "Abstract": "Among the many stressors astronauts are exposed to during spaceflight, cosmic radiation may lead to various serious health effects. Specifically, space radiation may contribute to decreased immunity, which has been documented in astronauts during short- and long-duration missions, as evidenced by several changes in cellular immunity and plasma cytokine levels. Reactivation of latent herpes viruses, either directly from radiation of latently infected cells and/or from perturbation of the immune system, may result in disease in astronauts. Epstein\u2012Barr virus (EBV) is one of the eight human herpes viruses known to infect more than 90% of human adults and persists for the life of the host without normally causing adverse effects. Reactivation of several latent viruses in astronauts is well documented, although the mechanism of reactivation is not well understood. We studied the effect of four different types of radiation, (1) 137Cs gamma rays, (2) 150-MeV protons, (3) 600 MeV/n carbon ions, and (4) 600 MeV/n iron ions on the activation of lytic gene transcription and of reactivation of EBV in a latently infected cell line (Akata) at doses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. The data showed that for all doses used in this study, lytic gene transcription was induced and median viral loads were significantly higher for all types of radiation than in corresponding control samples, with the increases detected as early as four days post-exposure and generally tapering off at later time points. The viability and size of EBV-infected Akata cells were highly variable and exhibited approximately the same trend in time for all radiation types at 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. This work shows that reactivation of viruses can occur due to the effect of different types of radiation on latently infected cells in the absence of changes or cytokines produced in the immune system. In general, gamma rays are more effective than protons, carbon ions, and iron ions in inducing latent virus reactivation, though these high-energy particles did induce more sustained and later reactivation of EBV lytic gene transcription. These findings also challenge the common relative biological effectiveness concept that is often used in radiobiology for other end points.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundSpaceflight impacts astronauts in many ways but little is known on how spaceflight affects the salivary microbiome and the consequences of these changes on astronaut health, such as viral reactivation. In order to understand this, the salivary microbiome was analyzed with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and saliva viral titers were analyzed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with primers specific for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) from 10 astronauts pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight. ResultsStreptococcus was the most abundant organism in the saliva, making up 8% of the total organisms detected, and their diversity decreased during spaceflight. Other organisms that had statistically significant changes were Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria which increased during flight and Actinobacteria which decreased during flight. At the genus level, Catonella, Megasphera, and Actinobacillus were absent in more than half of saliva samples collected pre-flight but were then detected during flight. In those subjects that already had these genera pre-flight, their relative abundances increased during flight. Correlation analyses between the microbiome and viral titers revealed a positive correlation with Gracilibacteria, Absconditabacteria, and Abiotrophia and a negative correlation between Oribacterium, Veillonella, and Haemophilus. There was also a significant positive correlation between microbiome richness and EBV viral titers. ConclusionsThis is the first study to look at how the salivary microbiome changes as a result of spaceflight and the search for bacterial biomarkers for viral reactivation. Further studies examining the role of specific organisms that were shown to be correlative and predictive in viral reactivation, a serious problem in astronauts during spaceflight, could lead to mitigation strategies to help prevent disease during both short and long duration space missions.

        "Abstract": "Plant roots navigate in the soil environment following the gravity vector. Cell divisions in the meristem and rapid cell growth in the elongation zone propel the root tips through the soil. Actively elongating cells acidify their apoplast to enable cell wall extension by the activity of plasma membrane AHA H+-ATPases. The phytohormone auxin, central regulator of gravitropic response and root development, inhibits root cell growth, likely by rising the pH of the apoplast. However, the role of auxin in the regulation of the apoplastic pH gradient along the root tip is unclear. Here, we show, by using an improved method for visualization and quantification of root surface pH, that the Arabidopsis thaliana root surface pH shows distinct acidic and alkaline zones, which are not primarily determined by the activity of AHA H+-ATPases. Instead, the distinct domain of alkaline pH in the root transition zone is controlled by a rapid auxin response module, consisting of the AUX1 auxin influx carrier, the AFB1 auxin co-receptor, and the CNCG14 calcium channel. We demonstrate that the rapid auxin response pathway is required for an efficient navigation of the root tip.",

The underlying mechanism of such stem cell dysfunction is not fully known. Here, we demonstrate that the distinct early telomere shortening of diseased MuSCs in both mice and young DMD patients is associated with aberrant NF-\u03baB activation. We find that prolonged NF-\u03baB activation in MuSCs in chronic injuries leads to shortened telomeres and Ku80 dysregulation and results in severe skeletal muscle defects. Our studies provide evidence of a role for NF-\u03baB in regulating stem-cell-specific telomere length, independently of cell replication, and could be a congruent mechanism that is applicable to additional tissues and/or diseases characterized by systemic chronic inflammation.",

Here, we demonstrate that quiescent MuSCs are morphologically heterogeneous and exhibit different patterns of cellular protrusions. We classified quiescent MuSCs into three functionally distinct stem cell states: responsive, intermediate, and sensory. We demonstrate that the shift between different stem cell states promotes regeneration and is regulated by the sensing protein Piezo1. Pharmacological activation of Piezo1 is sufficient to prime MuSCs toward more responsive cells. Piezo1 deletion in MuSCs shifts the distribution toward less responsive cells, mimicking the disease phenotype we find in dystrophic muscles. We further demonstrate that Piezo1 reactivation ameliorates the MuSC morphological and regenerative defects of dystrophic muscles. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of how stem cells respond to injury and identify Piezo1 as a key regulator for adjusting stem cell states essential for regeneration.",

This study investigates telomere alterations in grounded mice experiencing radiation exposure and muscle atrophy, via a hindlimb unloading spaceflight mimicking model. We find telomere lengthening is present in muscle stem cells and in myofiber nuclei, but not in muscle-resident endothelial cells. We further assessed telomere length in the model following hindlimb unloading recovery. We find that telomere length failed to return to baseline values. Our results suggest a role for telomeres in muscle acclimatization, which is relevant for the well-being of astronauts in space, and upon their return to Earth.",

        "Abstract": "To sustain normal growth and allow rapid responses to environmental cues, plants alter the plasma membrane protein composition under different conditions presumably by regulation of delivery, stability, and internalization. Exocytosis is a conserved cellular process that delivers proteins and lipids to the plasma membrane or extracellular space in eukaryotes. The octameric exocyst complex contributes to exocytosis by tethering secretory vesicles to the correct site for membrane fusion; however, whether the exocyst complex acts universally for all secretory vesicle cargo or just for specialized subsets used during polarized growth and trafficking is currently unknown. In addition to its role in exocytosis, the exocyst complex is also known to participate in membrane recycling and autophagy. Using a previously identified small molecule inhibitor of the plant exocyst complex subunit EXO70A1, Endosidin2 (ES2), combined with a plasma membrane enrichment method and quantitative proteomic analysis, we examined the composition of plasma membrane proteins in the root of Arabidopsis seedlings, after inhibition of the ES2-targetted exocyst complex, and verified our findings by live imaging of GFP-tagged plasma membrane proteins in root epidermal cells. The abundance of 145 plasma membrane proteins was significantly reduced following short-term ES2 treatments and these likely represent candidate cargo proteins of exocyst-mediated trafficking. Gene Ontology analysis showed that these proteins play diverse functions in cell growth, cell wall biosynthesis, hormone signaling, stress response, membrane transport, and nutrient uptake. Additionally, we quantified the effect of ES2 on the spatial distribution of EXO70A1 with live-cell imaging. Our results indicate that the plant exocyst complex mediates constitutive dynamic transport of subsets of plasma membrane proteins during normal root growth.",
        "Conclusion": "Using a 2-h treatment with the exocyst subunit EXO70A1 inhibitor ES2 in combination with plasma membrane enrichment, quantitative proteomic analyses, and live-cell imaging, we identified subsets of plasma membrane proteins that require the ES2-targeted exocyst complex for constitutive trafficking to the plasma membrane in Arabidopsis root cells. Our dataset provides new insights for the identification of novel cargo proteins of the exocyst complex.",

        "Abstract": "Auxin is transported in plants with distinct polarity, defined by transport proteins of the PIN-formed (PIN) family. Components of the complex trafficking machinery responsible for polar PIN protein localization have been identified by genetic approaches, but severe developmental phenotypes of trafficking mutants complicate dissection of this pathway. We utilized a temperature sensitive allele of Arabidopsis thaliana SCD1 (stomatal cytokinesis defective1) that encodes a RAB-guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Auxin transport, lateral root initiation, asymmetric auxin-induced gene expression after gravitropic reorientation, and differential gravitropic growth were reduced in the roots of the scd1-1 mutant relative to wild type at the restrictive temperature of 25\u00b0C, but not at the permissive temperature of 18\u00b0C. In scd1-1 at 25\u00b0C, PIN1- and PIN2-GFP accumulated in endomembrane bodies. Transition of seedlings from 18 to 25\u00b0C for as little as 20 min resulted in the accumulation of PIN2-GFP in endomembranes, while gravitropism and root developmental defects were not detected until hours after transition to the non-permissive temperature. The endomembrane compartments that accumulated PIN2-GFP in scd1-1 exhibited FM4-64 signal colocalized with ARA7 and ARA6 fluorescent marker proteins, consistent with PIN2 accumulation in the late or multivesicular endosome. These experiments illustrate the power of using a temperature sensitive mutation in the gene encoding SCD1 to study the trafficking of PIN2 between the endosome and the plasma membrane. Using the conditional feature of this mutation, we show that altered trafficking of PIN2 precedes altered auxin transport and defects in gravitropism and lateral root development in this mutant upon transition to the restrictive temperature.",

This virus and disease have significantly affected people worldwide, whether directly and/or indirectly, with a virulent pathogen that continues to evolve as we race to learn how to prevent, control, or cure COVID-19. The focus of this review is on the SARS-CoV-2 virus\u2019 mechanism of infection and its proclivity at adapting and restructuring the intracellular environment to support viral replication. We highlight current knowledge and how scientific communities with expertize in viral, cellular, and clinical biology have contributed to increase our understanding of SARS-CoV-2, and how these findings may help explain the widely varied clinical observations of COVID-19 patients.",
        "Conclusion": "The causative agent of the COVID-19 the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, has caused loss of incomes, economic crises, morbidities, and loss of life worldwide. Here, we describe the virus and review state-of-the-art information about the processes it utilizes to enter and reprogram the human host machinery. We detail research on early infection using evidence from patient samples, organoids and cells, and non-human animal studies. Each of these has limitations but taken together provide unique observational and mechanistic insight on SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 is a pleiotropic condition. Viral insults and subsequent cellular metabolic adaptations differ in the context of cell-type, genotype and environmental influences. Thus, much of what we have presented applies to specific cell types and contexts, and we have attempted to cover these contexts. Key avenues of future research on SARS-CoV-2 infection and propagation include: 1) defining the mechanisms of how the virus enters cells, and the protein and receptor molecules that are critical to this process; 2) elucidating the dynamics of how protein machinery is captured and retrofitted for viral purposes in a cell-specific manner; 3) understanding how the host genetics and environment can affect the ability of the virus to infect; 4) understanding the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation; and 5) revealing how the mitochondria adapts to ultimately shift its physiology from steady-state. In the best-case scenario for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, infection leads to a cascade of intracellular adaptations in which multiple networks are remodeled, from transcription to metabolism to signal transduction, shifting the invaded host cell from its original physiology into a SARS-CoV-2 replication system, and causing the emission of new viral particles and signaling molecules. The subsequent disease events will reverberate across the body\u2019s cells and organs. This will be the subject of our Part 2 review (in preparation).",

In our study, we used a simulated microgravity device, a 3-D clinostat (Gravite), to investigate whether the LINC complex mediates cellular responses to the simulated microgravity environment. We show that nuclear shape and differential gene expression are both responsive to simulated microgravity in a LINC-dependent manner and that this response changes with the duration of exposure to simulated microgravity.

Because most water on present-day Mars is frozen in the regolith, permafrosts are considered to be terrestrial analogs of the martian subsurface environment. Six bacterial isolates were obtained from a permafrost borehole in northeastern Siberia capable of growth under conditions of low temperature (0 \u00b0C), low pressure (7 mbar), and a CO2-enriched anoxic atmosphere. By 16S ribosomal DNA analysis, all six permafrost isolates were identified as species of the genus Carnobacterium, most closely related to C. inhibens (five isolates) and C. viridans (one isolate). Quantitative growth assays demonstrated that the six permafrost isolates, as well as nine type species of Carnobacterium (C. alterfunditum, C. divergens, C. funditum, C. gallinarum, C. inhibens, C. maltaromaticum, C. mobile, C. pleistocenium, and C. viridans) were all capable of growth under cold, low-pressure, anoxic conditions, thus extending the low-pressure extreme at which life can function.",

In contrast, despite the fact that the growth of most bacteria is inhibited at pressures below \u223c2.5 kPa, little is known of microbial responses to low pressure (LP). To study the global LP response, we performed transcription microarrays on Bacillus subtilis cells grown under normal atmospheric pressure (\u223c101 kPa) and a nearly inhibitory LP (5 kPa), equivalent to the pressure found at an altitude of \u223c20 km. Microarray analysis revealed altered levels of 363 transcripts belonging to several global regulons (AbrB, CcpA, CodY, Fur, IolR, ResD, Rok, SigH, Spo0A). Notably, the highest number of upregulated genes, 86, belonged to the SigB-mediated general stress response (GSR) regulon. Upregulation of the GSR by LP was confirmed by monitoring the expression of the SigB-dependent ctc-lacZ reporter fusion. Measuring transcriptome changes resulting from exposure of bacterial cells to LP reveals insights into cellular processes that may respond to LP exposure.",

Spores deficient in DNA repair by NHEJ or AP endonucleases, the oxidative stress response, or protection by major \u03b1/\u03b2-type SASP, DPA, and decreased core water content were significantly more sensitive to ionizing radiation than wild-type spores, with highest sensitivity to high-energy-charged iron ions. DNA repair via NHEJ and AP endonucleases appears to be the most important mechanism for spore resistance to ionizing radiation, whereas oxygen radical detoxification via the MrgA-mediated oxidative stress response or KatX catalase activity plays only a very minor role. Synergistic radioprotective effects of \u03b1/\u03b2-type but not \u03b3-type SASP were also identified, indicating that \u03b1/\u03b2-type SASP's binding to spore DNA is important in preventing DNA damage due to reactive oxygen species generated by ionizing radiation.",

Bacteria are critical to ecosystems, helping recycle nutrients, break down organic matter, and support plant growth. If they struggle to adapt to warmer conditions, the effects could ripple through ecosystems. Our study tested whether Bacillus bacteria, common in soil and water, could adapt to gradual temperature increases. We exposed seven strains from two groups to experimental evolution under increasing warming conditions, expecting them to evolve heat tolerance. Although some bacteria showed small improvements in heat tolerance, neither group could evolve to grow well at temperatures just three degrees Celsius above their natural range. This is concerning, as climate change could raise global temperatures by 2\u20134 \u00b0C, which could push these bacteria beyond their limits. We also found that c-di-AMP, a molecule that helps regulate potassium levels in cells, was involved in temperature tolerance. These findings highlight the vulnerability of essential bacteria to climate change and underscore the need for further research to predict and mitigate its impacts on ecosystems.",

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Past results have suggested that bacterial antibiotic susceptibility is altered during space flight. To test this notion, Bacillus subtilis cells were cultivated in matched hardware, medium, and environmental conditions either in space flight microgravity on the International Space Station, termed flight (FL) samples, or at Earth-normal gravity, termed ground control (GC) samples. The susceptibility of FL and GC samples was compared to 72 antibiotics and growth-inhibitory compounds using the Omnilog phenotype microarray (PM) system. Only 9 compounds were identified by PM screening as exhibiting significant differences (P < 0.05, Student's t test) in FL versus GC samples: 6-mercaptopurine, cesium chloride, enoxacin, lomefloxacin, manganese(II) chloride, nalidixic acid, penimepicycline, rolitetracycline, and trifluoperazine. Testing of the same compounds by standard broth dilution assay did not reveal statistically significant differences in the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) between FL and GC samples. The results indicate that the susceptibility of B. subtilis cells to a wide range of antibiotics and growth inhibitors is not dramatically altered by space flight. IMPORTANCE This study addresses a major concern of mission planners for human space flight, that bacteria accompanying astronauts on long-duration missions might develop a higher level of resistance to antibiotics due to exposure to the space flight environment. The results of this study do not support that notion.",

However, nucleotide sequencing of the RifR regions of the rpoB gene from RifR mutants revealed dramatic differences in the spectrum of mutations between flight (FL) and ground control (GC) samples, including two newly discovered rpoB alleles in the FL samples (Q137R and L489S). The results strengthen the idea that exposure to the human spaceflight environment causes unique stresses on bacteria, leading to alterations in their mutagenic potential.",

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT RNA polymerase (RNAP) is a highly conserved macromolecular machine that contributes to the flow of genetic information from genotype to phenotype. In Bacillus subtilis, mutations in the rpoB gene encoding the \u03b2-subunit of RNAP have been shown to alter a number of global phenotypes, including growth, utilization of unusual nutrient sources, sporulation, germination, and production of secondary metabolites. In addition, the spectrum of mutations in rpoB leading to rifampin resistance (Rifr) can change dramatically depending upon the environment to which B. subtilis cells or spores are exposed. Rifr rpoB mutations have historically been associated with slower growth and reduced fitness; however, these assessments of fitness were conducted on limited collections of mutants in rich laboratory media that poorly reflect natural environments typically inhabited by B. subtilis. Using a novel deep-sequencing approach in addition to traditional measurements of growth rate, lag time, and pairwise competitions, we demonstrated that the competitive advantages of specific rpoB alleles differ depending on the growth environment in which they are determined. IMPORTANCE Microbial resistance to antibiotics is a growing threat to public health across the world. Historically, resistance to antibiotics has been associated with reduced fitness. A growing body of evidence indicates that resistance to rifampin, a frontline antibiotic used to treat mycobacterial and biofilm-associated infections, may increase fitness given an appropriate environment even in the absence of the selective antibiotic. Here, we experimentally confirm this phenomenon by directly comparing the fitness of multiple rifampin-resistant mutants of Bacillus subtilis in rich LB medium and an asparagine minimal medium. Our research demonstrates that the fitness cost of rifampin resistance can vary greatly depending upon the environment. This has important implications for understanding how microbes develop antimicrobial resistance in the absence of antibiotic selection.",

        "Abstract": "The prevailing paradigm of Salmonella enteropathogenesis based on monolayers asserts that Salmonella pathogenicity island-1 Type Three Secretion System (SPI-1 T3SS) is required for bacterial invasion into intestinal epithelium. However, little is known about the role of SPI-1 in mediating gastrointestinal disease in humans. Recently, SPI-1 deficient nontyphoidal Salmonella strains were isolated from infected humans and animals, indicating that SPI-1 is not required to cause enteropathogenesis and demonstrating the need for more in vivo-like models. Here, we utilized a previously characterized 3-D organotypic model of human intestinal epithelium to elucidate the role of all characterized Salmonella enterica T3SSs. Similar to in vivo reports, the Salmonella SPI-1 T3SS was not required to invade 3-D intestinal cells. Additionally, Salmonella strains carrying single (SPI-1 or SPI-2), double (SPI-1/2) and complete T3SS knockout (SPI-1/SPI-2: flhDC) also invaded 3-D intestinal cells to wildtype levels. Invasion of wildtype and TTSS mutants was a Salmonella active process, whereas non-invasive bacterial strains, bacterial size beads, and heat-killed Salmonella did not invade 3-D cells. Wildtype and T3SS mutants did not preferentially target different cell types identified within the 3-D intestinal aggregates, including M-cells/M-like cells, enterocytes, or Paneth cells. Moreover, each T3SS was necessary for substantial intracellular bacterial replication within 3-D cells. Collectively, these results indicate that T3SSs are dispensable for Salmonella invasion into highly differentiated 3-D models of human intestinal epithelial cells, but are required for intracellular bacterial growth, paralleling in vivo infection observations and demonstrating the utility of these models in predicting in vivo-like pathogenic mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection occurs in differentiating epithelial tissues, and cancers caused by the high-risk types (e.g., HPV16 and HPV18) typically occur at oropharyngeal and anogenital anatomical sites. The HPV life cycle is differentiation-dependent, requiring tissue culture methodology able to recapitulate the three-dimensional (3D) stratified epithelium. Here we report two distinct and complementary methods to grow differentiating epithelial tissues that mimic many critical morphological and biochemical aspects of in vivo tissue. The first approach involves growing primary human epithelial cells on top of a dermal equivalent consisting of collagen fibers and living fibroblast cells. When these cells are grown at the liquid-air interface, differentiation occurs and allows for epithelial stratification. The second approach uses a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. The low-fluid-shear microgravity environment inside the bioreactor allows the cells to use collagen-coated microbeads as a growth scaffold and self assemble into 3D cellular aggregates. These approaches are applied to epithelial cells derived from HPV-positive and -negative oral and cervical tissues. The second part of the protocol introduces potential downstream applications for these 3D tissue models. We describe methods that will allow readers to start successfully culturing 3D tissues from oral and cervical cells. These tissues have been used for microscopic visualization, scanning-electron microscopy, and large -omics studies to gain insights into epithelial biology, the HPV life cycle, and host-pathogen interactions.

        "Abstract": "The opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus encounters a wide variety of fluid shear levels within the human host, and they may play a key role in dictating whether this organism adopts a commensal interaction with the host or transitions to cause disease. By using rotating-wall vessel bioreactors to create a physiologically relevant, low-fluid-shear environment, S. aureus was evaluated for cellular responses that could impact its colonization and virulence. S. aureus cells grown in a low-fluid-shear environment initiated a novel attachment-independent biofilm phenotype and were completely encased in extracellular polymeric substances. Compared to controls, low-shear-cultured cells displayed slower growth and repressed virulence characteristics, including decreased carotenoid production, increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, and reduced survival in whole blood. Transcriptional whole-genome microarray profiling suggested alterations in metabolic pathways. Further genetic expression analysis revealed downregulation of the RNA chaperone Hfq, which parallels low-fluid-shear responses of certain Gram-negative organisms. This is the first study to report an Hfq association with fluid shear in a Gram-positive organism, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved response to fluid shear among structurally diverse prokaryotes. Collectively, our results suggest S. aureus responds to a low-fluid-shear environment by initiating a biofilm/colonization phenotype with diminished virulence characteristics, which could lead to insight into key factors influencing the divergence between infection and colonization during the initial host-pathogen interaction.",

        "Abstract": "Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium possesses a stimulon of genes that are differentially regulated in response to conditions of low fluid shear force that increase bacterial virulence and alter other phenotypes. In this study, we show that a previously uncharacterized member of this stimulon, ydcI or STM1625, encodes a highly conserved DNA binding protein with related homologs present in a range of Gram-negative bacterial genera. Gene expression analysis shows that ydcI is expressed in different bacterial genera and is involved in its autoregulation in S. Typhimurium. We demonstrate that purified YdcI protein specifically binds a DNA probe consisting of its own promoter sequence. We constructed an S. Typhimurium \u0394ydcI mutant strain and show that this strain is more sensitive to both organic and inorganic acid stress than is an isogenic WT strain, and this defect is complemented in trans. Moreover, our data indicate that ydcI is part of the rpoS regulon related to stress resistance. The S. Typhimurium \u0394ydcI mutant was able to invade cultured cells to the same degree as the WT strain, but a strain in which ydcI expression is induced invaded cells at a level 2.8 times higher than that of the WT. In addition, induction of ydcI expression in S. Typhimurium resulted in the formation of a biofilm in stationary-phase cultures. These data indicate the ydcI gene encodes a conserved DNA binding protein involved with aspects of prokaryotic biology related to stress resistance and possibly virulence.",

        "Abstract": "Investigation into the causes underlying the rapid, global amphibian decline provides critical insight into the effects of changing ecosystems. Hypothesized and confirmed links between amphibian declines, disease, and environmental changes are increasingly represented in published literature. However, there are few long-term amphibian studies that include data on population size, abnormality/injury rates, disease, and habitat variables to adequately assess changes through time. We cultured and identified microorganisms isolated from abnormal/injured and repressed tissue regeneration sites of the endangered Ozark Hellbender, Cryptobranchus alleganiensis bishopi, to discover potential causative agents responsible for their significant decline in health and population. This organism and our study site were chosen because the population and habitat of C. a. bishopi have been intensively studied from 1969\u20132009, and the abnormality/injury rate and apparent lack of regeneration were established. Although many bacterial and fungal isolates recovered were common environmental organisms, several opportunistic pathogens were identified in association with only the injured tissues of C.a. bishopi. Bacterial isolates included Aeromonas hydrophila, a known amphibian pathogen, Granulicetella adiacens, Gordonai terrae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Aerococcus viridans, Streptococcus pneumoniae and a variety of Pseudomonads, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. stutzeri, and P. alcaligenes. Fungal isolates included species in the genera Penicillium, Acremonium, Cladosporium, Curvularia, Fusarium, Streptomycetes, and the Class Hyphomycetes. Many of the opportunistic pathogens identified are known to form biofilms. Lack of isolation of the same organism from all wounds suggests that the etiological agent responsible for the damage to C. a. bishopi may not be a single organism. To our knowledge, this is the first study to profile the external microbial consortia cultured from a Cryptobranchid salamander. The incidence of abnormalities/injury and retarded regeneration in C. a. bishopi may have many contributing factors including disease and habitat degradation. Results from this study may provide insight into other amphibian population declines.",

        "Abstract": "Assessing bacterial behavior in microgravity is important for risk assessment and prevention of infectious diseases during spaceflight missions. Furthermore, this research field allows the unveiling of novel connections between low-fluid-shear regions encountered by pathogens during their natural infection process and bacterial virulence. This study is the first to characterize the spaceflight-induced global transcriptional and proteomic responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen that is present in the space habitat. P. aeruginosa responded to spaceflight conditions through differential regulation of 167 genes and 28 proteins, with Hfq as a global transcriptional regulator. Since Hfq was also differentially regulated in spaceflight-grown Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Hfq represents the first spaceflight-induced regulator acting across bacterial species. The major P. aeruginosa virulence-related genes induced in spaceflight were the lecA and lecB lectin genes and the gene for rhamnosyltransferase (rhlA), which is involved in rhamnolipid production. The transcriptional response of spaceflight-grown P. aeruginosa was compared with our previous data for this organism grown in microgravity analogue conditions using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. Interesting similarities were observed, including, among others, similarities with regard to Hfq regulation and oxygen metabolism. While RWV-grown P. aeruginosa mainly induced genes involved in microaerophilic metabolism, P. aeruginosa cultured in spaceflight presumably adopted an anaerobic mode of growth, in which denitrification was most prominent. Whether the observed changes in pathogenesis-related gene expression in response to spaceflight culture could lead to an alteration of virulence in P. aeruginosa remains to be determined and will be important for infectious disease risk assessment and prevention, both during spaceflight missions and for the general public.",

        "Abstract": "Extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), including avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC), pose a considerable threat to both human and animal health, with illness causing substantial economic loss. APEC strain \u03c77122 (O78\u2236K80\u2236H9), containing three large plasmids [pChi7122-1 (IncFIB/FIIA-FIC), pChi7122-2 (IncFII), and pChi7122-3 (IncI2)]; and a small plasmid pChi7122-4 (ColE2-like), has been used for many years as a model strain to study the molecular mechanisms of ExPEC pathogenicity and zoonotic potential. We previously sequenced and characterized the plasmid pChi7122-1 and determined its importance in systemic APEC infection; however the roles of the other pChi7122 plasmids were still ambiguous. Herein we present the sequence of the remaining pChi7122 plasmids, confirming that pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 encode an ABC iron transport system (eitABCD) and a putative type IV fimbriae respectively, whereas pChi7122-4 is a cryptic plasmid. New features were also identified, including a gene cluster on pChi7122-2 that is not present in other E. coli strains but is found in Salmonella serovars and is predicted to encode the sugars catabolic pathways. In vitro evaluation of the APEC \u03c77122 derivative strains with the three large plasmids, either individually or in combinations, provided new insights into the role of plasmids in biofilm formation, bile and acid tolerance, and the interaction of E. coli strains with 3-D cultures of intestinal epithelial cells. In this study, we show that the nature and combinations of plasmids, as well as the background of the host strains, have an effect on these phenomena. Our data reveal new insights into the role of extra-chromosomal sequences in fitness and diversity of ExPEC in their phenotypes.",
        "Conclusion": "A novel putative sugar utilization pathway operon that is not present in other E. coli strains but found in Salmonella serovars, an ABC iron transport system and a type IV fimbriae pil operon were located on pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 respectively. Multiple plasmid-encoded mechanisms, including toxin-antitoxin modules and the novel sugar pathway could be important in the fitness and persistence of APEC \u03c77122. Large plasmids were involved in bile resistance (pChi7122-1 and pChi7122-2) when present in E. coli K-12 background and acid tolerance (pChi7122-3) in the wild-type background. Four different factor-driven biofilms, including plasmidless-, plasmid-, rough-LPS-, and O-LPS-mediated were demonstrated. These multiple factor-driven biofilms expressed at different temperatures could have distinct functions. Some of them could be important in the acquisition of genetic material and persistence of bacteria in the environment; others could be involved in virulence. The genotypic and phenotypic analysis of plasmid-derivative strains of an ExPEC model strain \u03c77122 (O78\u2236K80\u2236H9) revealed new insights into the mechanisms of fitness of ExPEC and their diversity.",

        "Abstract": "Low fluid shear force, including that encountered in microgravity models, induces bacterial responses, but the range of bacteria capable of responding to this signal remains poorly characterized. We systematically analyzed a range of Gram negative Enterobacteriaceae for conservation of the low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) response using phenotypic assays, qPCR, and targeted mutations. Our results indicate LSMMG response conservation across Enterobacteriacae with potential variance in up- or down-regulation of a given response depending on genus. Based on the data, we analyzed the role of the trp operon genes and the TrpR regulator in the LSMMG response using targeted mutations in these genes in S. Typhimurium and E. coli. We found no alteration of the LSMMG response compared to WT in these mutant strains under the conditions tested here. To our knowledge, this study is first-of-kind for Citrobacter, Enterobacter, and Serratia, presents novel data for Escherichia, and provides the first analysis of trp genes in LSMMG responses. This impacts our understanding of how LSMMG affects bacteria and our ability to modify bacteria with this condition in the future.",

        "Abstract": "Why is a healthy person protected from Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, while individuals with cystic fibrosis or damaged epithelium are particularly susceptible to this opportunistic pathogen? In order to address this question, it is essential to thoroughly understand the dynamic interplay between the host microenvironment and P. aeruginosa. Therefore, using modeI systems that represent key aspects of human mucosal tissues in health and disease allows recreating in vivo host-pathogen interactions in a physiologically relevant manner. In this review, we discuss how factors of mucosal tissues, such as apical-basolateral polarity, junctional complexes, extracellular matrix proteins, mucus, multicellular complexity (including indigenous microbiota), and other physicochemical factors affect P. aeruginosa pathogenesis and are thus important to mimic in vitro. We highlight in vitro cell and tissue culture model systems of increasing complexity that have been used over the past 35 years to study the infectious disease process of P. aeruginosa, mainly focusing on lung models, and their respective advantages and limitations. Continued improvements of in vitro models based on our expanding knowledge of host microenvironmental factors that participate in P. aeruginosa pathogenesis will help advance fundamental understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and increase the translational potential of research findings from bench to the patient\u2019s bedside.",

        "Abstract": "To address urgent need for strategies to limit mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), this review describes experimental, clinical and epidemiological evidence that suggests that chronic sub-optimal hydration in the weeks before infection might increase risk of COVID-19 mortality in multiple ways. Sub-optimal hydration is associated with key risk factors for COVID-19 mortality, including older age, male sex, race-ethnicity and chronic disease. Chronic hypertonicity, total body water deficit and/or hypovolemia cause multiple intracellular and/or physiologic adaptations that preferentially retain body water and favor positive total body water balance when challenged by infection. Via effects on serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) signaling, aldosterone, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), aquaporin 5 (AQP5) and/or Na+/K+-ATPase, chronic sub-optimal hydration in the weeks before exposure to COVID-19 may conceivably result in: greater abundance of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in the lung, which increases likelihood of COVID-19 infection, lung epithelial cells which are pre-set for exaggerated immune response, increased capacity for capillary leakage of fluid into the airway space, and/or reduced capacity for both passive and active transport of fluid out of the airways. The hypothesized hydration effects suggest hypotheses regarding strategies for COVID-19 risk reduction, such as public health recommendations to increase intake of drinking water, hydration screening alongside COVID-19 testing, and treatment tailored to the pre-infection hydration condition. Hydration may link risk factors and pathways in a unified mechanism for COVID-19 mortality. Attention to hydration holds potential to reduce COVID-19 mortality and disparities via at least 5 pathways simultaneously.",

We demonstrate that decellularized mouse lungs recellularized in a dynamic low fluid shear suspension bioreactor, termed the rotating wall vessel (RWV), contained more cells with decreased apoptosis, increased proliferation and enhanced levels of total RNA compared to static recellularization conditions. These results were observed with two relevant mouse cell types: bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells (MSCs) and alveolar type II cells (C10). In addition, MSCs cultured in decellularized lungs under static but not bioreactor conditions formed multilayered aggregates. Gene expression and immunohistochemical analyses suggested differentiation of MSCs into collagen I-producing fibroblast-like cells in the bioreactor, indicating enhanced potential for remodeling of the decellularized scaffold matrix. In conclusion, dynamic suspension culture is promising for enhancing repopulation of decellularized lungs, and could contribute to remodeling the extracellular matrix of the scaffolds with subsequent effects on differentiation and functionality of inoculated cells.",

        "Abstract": "Three-dimensional models of human intestinal epithelium mimic the differentiated form and function of parental tissues often not exhibited by two-dimensional monolayers and respond to Salmonella in key ways that reflect in vivo infections. To further enhance the physiological relevance of three-dimensional models to more closely approximate in vivo intestinal microenvironments encountered by Salmonella, we developed and validated a novel three-dimensional co-culture infection model of colonic epithelial cells and macrophages using the NASA Rotating Wall Vessel bioreactor. First, U937 cells were activated upon collagen-coated scaffolds. HT-29 epithelial cells were then added and the three-dimensional model was cultured in the bioreactor until optimal differentiation was reached, as assessed by immunohistochemical profiling and bead uptake assays. The new co-culture model exhibited in vivo-like structural and phenotypic characteristics, including three-dimensional architecture, apical-basolateral polarity, well-formed tight/adherens junctions, mucin, multiple epithelial cell types, and functional macrophages. Phagocytic activity of macrophages was confirmed by uptake of inert, bacteria-sized beads. Contribution of macrophages to infection was assessed by colonization studies of Salmonella pathovars with different host adaptations and disease phenotypes (Typhimurium ST19 strain SL1344 and ST313 strain D23580; Typhi Ty2). \ufeff\ufeffIn addition, Salmonella were cultured aerobically or microaerobically, recapitulating environments encountered prior to and during intestinal infection, respectively\ufeff. All Salmonella strains exhibited decreased colonization in co-culture (HT-29-U937) relative to epithelial (HT-29) models, indicating antimicrobial function of macrophages. Interestingly, D23580 exhibited enhanced replication/survival in both models following invasion. Pathovar-specific differences in colonization and intracellular co-localization patterns were observed. These findings emphasize the power of incorporating a series of related three-dimensional models within a study to identify microenvironmental factors important for regulating infection.",
        "Conclusion": "In summary, the 3-D co-culture model of human colonic epithelium in combination with immune cells that was engineered, validated and tested in this study represents a new tool to investigate mechanisms underlying enteric diseases with both non-infectious and infectious etiologies, including salmonellosis. Phagocytic macrophages were incorporated in the model in order to better recapitulate the multicellular complexity and structure of the parental tissue, thereby allowing for synergistic contributions of different cell types during infection to be assessed so that host-pathogen interactions can be studied in a more physiologically relevant context. In addition, we also demonstrated that this model could be used for investigations into the impact of different environmental parameters on colonization as well as co-localization patterns of pathogens with different host cell types. These findings emphasize the power of incorporating a series of related models with increasing complexity to study infectious disease mechanisms. Using this approach, we identified key microenvironmental factors (i.e., host multicellular complexity and oxygen) important for regulating pathovar-specific invasion and host co-localization properties. We continue to enhance the physiological relevance of these models by incorporation of additional cell types that are normally found in the tissue in vivo, including the use of primary cells, dendritic cells, B cells and T cells, which will continue to advance our mechanistic understanding of enteric infectious disease in the context of the host-microenvironment.",

        "Abstract": "Candida albicans is a commensal yeast that is a common component of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome of humans. C. albicans has been shown to bloom in the GI tract of individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and can promote and increase the severity of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). However, the effects of C. albicans blooms on the host in the context of AUD or AUD-related phenotypes, such as ethanol preference, have been unstudied. In this work, we report a reduction in ethanol consumption and preference in mice colonized with C. albicans. C. albicans-colonized mice exhibited elevated levels of serum PGE2 and reduced ethanol preference was reversed by injection with antagonists of PGE2 receptors. Further, injection of mice with a PGE2 derivative decreased their ethanol preference. These results show that PGE2 acting on its receptors EP1 and EP2 drives reduced ethanol preference in C. albicans-colonized mice. We also showed altered transcription of dopamine receptors in the dorsal striatum of C. albicans-colonized mice and more rapid acquisition of ethanol conditioned taste aversion, suggesting alterations to reinforcement or aversion learning. Finally, C. albicans-colonized mice were more susceptible to ethanol-induced motor coordination impairment showing significant alterations to the behavioral effects of ethanol. This study identifies a member of the fungal microbiome that alters ethanol preference and demonstrates a role for PGE2 signaling in these phenotypes.",

        "Abstract": "This study presents the first global transcriptional profiling and phenotypic characterization of the major human opportunistic fungal pathogen, Candida albicans, grown in spaceflight conditions. Microarray analysis revealed that C. albicans subjected to short-term spaceflight culture differentially regulated 452 genes compared to synchronous ground controls, which represented 8.3% of the analyzed ORFs. Spaceflight-cultured C. albicans\u2013induced genes involved in cell aggregation (similar to flocculation), which was validated by microscopic and flow cytometry analysis. We also observed enhanced random budding of spaceflight-cultured cells as opposed to bipolar budding patterns for ground samples, in accordance with the gene expression data. Furthermore, genes involved in antifungal agent and stress resistance were differentially regulated in spaceflight, including induction of ABC transporters and members of the major facilitator family, downregulation of ergosterol-encoding genes, and upregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress resistance. Finally, downregulation of genes involved in actin cytoskeleton was observed. Interestingly, the transcriptional regulator Cap1 and over 30% of the Cap1 regulon was differentially expressed in spaceflight-cultured C. albicans. A potential role for Cap1 in the spaceflight response of C. albicans is suggested, as this regulator is involved in random budding, cell aggregation, and oxidative stress resistance; all related to observed spaceflight-associated changes of C. albicans. While culture of C. albicans in microgravity potentiates a global change in gene expression that could induce a virulence-related phenotype, no increased virulence in a murine intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection model was observed under the conditions of this study. Collectively, our data represent an important basis for the assessment of the risk that commensal flora could play during human spaceflight missions. Furthermore, since the low fluid-shear environment of microgravity is relevant to physical forces encountered by pathogens during the infection process, insights gained from this study could identify novel infectious disease mechanisms, with downstream benefits for the general public.",

        "Abstract": "This report was designed to compare spaceflight-induced cellular and physiological adaptations of Candida albicans cultured in microgravity on the International Space Station across several payloads. C. albicans is a common opportunistic fungal pathogen responsible for a variety of superficial infections as well as systemic and more severe infections in humans. Cumulatively, the propensity of this organism to be widespread through the population, the ability to produce disease in immunocompromised individuals, and the tendency to respond to environmental stress with characteristics associated with increased virulence, require a better understanding of the yeast response to microgravity for spaceflight crew safety. As such, the responses of this yeast cultivated during several missions using two in-flight culture bioreactors were analyzed and compared herein. In general, C. albicans had a slightly shorter generation time and higher growth propensity in microgravity as compared to terrestrial controls. Rates of cell filamentation differed between bioreactors, but were low and not significantly different between flight and terrestrial controls. Viable cells were retrieved and cultured, resulting in a colony morphology that was similar between cells cultivated in flight and in terrestrial control conditions, and in contrast to that previously observed in a ground-based microgravity analog system. Of importance, yeast demonstrated an increased resistance when challenged during spaceflight with the antifungal agent, amphotericin B. Similar levels of resistance were not observed when challenged with the functionally disparate antifungal drug caspofungin. In aggregate, yeast cells cultivated in microgravity demonstrated a subset of characteristics associated with virulence. In addition, and beyond the value of the specific responses of C. albicans to microgravity, this report includes an analysis of biological reproducibility across flight opportunities, compares two spaceflight hardware systems, and includes a summary of general flight and payload timelines.",

        "Abstract": "Summary With the development of transcriptomic technologies, we are able to quantify precise changes in gene expression profiles from astronauts and other organisms exposed to spaceflight. Members of NASA GeneLab and GeneLab-associated analysis working groups (AWGs) have developed a consensus pipeline for analyzing short-read RNA-sequencing data from spaceflight-associated experiments. The pipeline includes quality control, read trimming, mapping, and gene quantification steps, culminating in the detection of differentially expressed genes. This data analysis pipeline and the results of its execution using data submitted to GeneLab are now all publicly available through the GeneLab database. We present here the full details and rationale for the construction of this pipeline in order to promote transparency, reproducibility, and reusability of pipeline data; to provide a template for data processing of future spaceflight-relevant datasets; and to encourage cross-analysis of data from other databases with the data available in GeneLab.",

The findings of spaceflight-based scRNA-seq and SRT investigations are likely to improve our understanding of life in space and our comprehension of gene expression in various cell systems and tissue dynamics. However, compared to their Earth-based counterparts, gene expression experiments conducted in spaceflight have not experienced the same pace of development. Out of the hundreds of spaceflight gene expression datasets available, only a few used scRNA-seq and SRT.

Biospecimen samples were collected from four crew members longitudinally before (Launch: L-92, L-44, L-3 days), during (Flight Day: FD1, FD2, FD3), and after (Return: R + 1, R + 45, R + 82, R + 194 days) spaceflight, spanning a total of 289 days across 2021-2022. The collection process included venous whole blood, capillary dried blood spot cards, saliva, urine, stool, body swabs, capsule swabs, SpaceX Dragon capsule HEPA filter, and skin biopsies. Venous whole blood was further processed to obtain aliquots of serum, plasma, extracellular vesicles and particles, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In total, 2,911 sample aliquots were shipped to our central lab at Weill Cornell Medicine for downstream assays and biobanking. This paper provides an overview of the extensive biospecimen collection and highlights their processing procedures and long-term biobanking techniques, facilitating future molecular tests and evaluations.As such, this study details a robust framework for obtaining and preserving high-quality human, microbial, and environmental samples for aerospace medicine in the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA) initiative, which can aid future human spaceflight and space biology experiments.",

The area of microfluidics has provided devices for faster screening of compounds, controlled sampling/sorting of whole animals, and automated behavioral pattern recognition. In most microfluidic devices, drug effects on small animals (e.g., Caenorhabditis elegans) are quantified by an end-point, dose response curve representing a single parameter (such as worm velocity or stroke frequency). Here, we present a multi-parameter extraction method to characterize modes of paralysis in C. elegans over an extended time period. A microfluidic device with real-time imaging is used to expose C. elegans to four anthelmintic drugs (i.e., pyrantel, levamisole, tribendimidine, and methyridine). We quantified worm behavior with parameters such as curls per second, types of paralyzation, mode frequency, and number/duration of active/immobilization periods. Each drug was chosen at EC75 where 75% of the worm population is responsive to the drug. At equipotent concentrations, we observed differences in the manner with which worms paralyzed in drug environments. Our study highlights the need for assaying drug effects on small animal models with multiple parameters quantified at regular time points over an extended period to adequately capture the resistance and adaptability in chemical environments.",

        "Abstract": "Environmental toxicants influence development, behavior, and ultimately survival. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has proven to be an exceptionally powerful model for toxicological studies. Here, we develop novel technologies to describe the effects of cyanide toxicity with high spatiotemporal resolution. Importantly, we use these methods to examine the genetic underpinnings of cyanide resistance. Caenorhabditis elegans that lack the EGL-9 oxygen sensing enzyme have been shown to be resistant to hydrogen cyanide (HCN) gas produced by the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. We demonstrate that the cyanide resistance exhibited by egl-9 mutants is completely dependent on the HIF-1 hypoxia-inducible factor and is mediated by the cysl-2 cysteine synthase, which likely functions in metabolic pathways that inactivate cyanide. Further, the expression of cysl-2 correlates with the degree of cyanide resistance exhibited in each genetic background. We find that each mutant exhibits similar relative resistance to HCN gas on plates or to aqueous potassium cyanide in microfluidic chambers. The design of the microfluidic devices, in combination with real-time imaging, addresses a series of challenges presented by mutant phenotypes and by the chemical nature of the toxicant. The microfluidic assay produces a set of behavioral parameters with increased resolution that describe cyanide toxicity and resistance in C. elegans, and this is particularly useful in analyzing subtle phenotypes. These multiparameter analyses of C. elegans behavior hold great potential as a means to monitor the effects of toxicants or chemical interventions in real time and to study the biological networks that underpin toxicant resistance.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundMartian regolith (unconsolidated surface material) is a potential medium for plant growth in bioregenerative life support systems during manned missions on Mars. However, hydrated magnesium sulfate mineral levels in the regolith of Mars can reach as high as 10 wt%, and would be expected to be highly inhibitory to plant growth. Methodology and Principal FindingsDisabling ion transporters AtMRS2-10 and AtSULTR1;2, which are plasma membrane localized in peripheral root cells, is not an effective way to confer tolerance to magnesium sulfate soils. Arabidopsis mrs2-10 and sel1-10 knockout lines do not mitigate the growth inhibiting impacts of high MgSO4\u00b77H2O concentrations observed with wildtype plants. A global approach was used to identify novel genes with potential to enhance tolerance to high MgSO4\u00b77H2O (magnesium sulfate) stress. The early Arabidopsis root transcriptome response to elevated concentrations of magnesium sulfate was characterized in Col-0, and also between Col-0 and the mutant line cax1-1, which was confirmed to be relatively tolerant of high levels of MgSO4\u00b77H2O in soil solution. Differentially expressed genes in Col-0 treated for 45 min. encode enzymes primarily involved in hormone metabolism, transcription factors, calcium-binding proteins, kinases, cell wall related proteins and membrane-based transporters. Over 200 genes encoding transporters were differentially expressed in Col-0 up to 180 min. of exposure, and one of the first down-regulated genes was CAX1. The importance of this early response in wildtype Arabidopsis is exemplified in the fact that only four transcripts were differentially expressed between Col-0 and cax1-1 at 180 min. after initiation of treatment. Conclusions/SignificanceThe results provide a solid basis for the understanding of the metabolic response of plants to elevated magnesium sulfate soils; it is the first transcriptome analysis of plants in this environment. The results foster the development of Mars soil-compatible plants by showing that cax1 mutants exhibit partial tolerance to magnesium sulfate, and by elucidating a small subset (500 vs. >10,000) of candidate genes for mutation or metabolic engineering that will enhance tolerance to magnesium sulfate soils.",
        "Conclusion": "It was initially thought that the mrs2-10 and sel1-10 mutants would have an advantage over wildtype in elevated magnesium sulfate soils, but this was not the case. However, fresh weight shoot biomass analyses showed that although mrs2-10 and sel1-10 mutants were not more successful than wildtype in this soil environment, the cax1 mutants were. Thus, cax1 mutants are currently the only confirmed genotype with partial tolerance to the phytotoxic levels of magnesium sulfate expected for the regolith on Mars. To further characterize the response of Arabidopsis to Mars-like levels of magnesium sulfate a set of experiments was conducted to evaluate patterns of gene expression in wildtype (Col-0) and cax1 mutants. The 325 genes differentially expressed in Col-0 roots after 45 min. of exposure to high magnesium sulfate can be seen as candidate genes for enhanced tolerance. This set of genes included CAX1, 18 genes previously associated with enhanced tolerance to broad ranges of abiotic stresses, and several well-characterized genes known to enhance tolerance to other salts like NaCl. Many of the differentially regulated genes contain promoter sequence motifs that are known to play a role in ABA-mediated regulation, such as ABRE-CE. This abundance suggests that ABA plays a role in regulating the stress response to elevated magnesium sulfate. In addition, a rich pool of candidates is found in the 200+ transporter genes that are differentially expressed in Col-0 across the time points. Many genes in this set encode transporters of unknown function. These unknown transporter genes, along with the four differentially regulated transcripts between cax1-1 and Col-0, are of particular interest as they encode proteins of unknown function whose roles are now at least implicated. This study functions as a solid basis for the development of Mars soil-compatible plants by reducing the number of potential candidate genes from tens of thousands to several hundred. Future research efforts could determine whether any of these candidate genes, or their potential regulators, can be confirmed as genomic loci for (crop) plant growth enhancement in the presence of mars-like levels of magnesium sulfate.",

For instance, 14-3-3 proteins influence the photosensory system through interactions with Constans (CO) protein. 14-3-3 associations with the photosensory system were further studied in this investigation using 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants to study root and chloroplast development. The 14-3-3 \u03bc T-DNA insertion mutant, 14-3-3\u03bc-1, had shorter roots than the wild type and the difference in root length could be influenced by light intensity. The 14-3-3 \u03bd T-DNA insertion mutants also had shorter roots, but only when grown under narrow-bandwidth red light. Five-day-old 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion and co mutants all had increased root greening compared with the wild type, which was influenced by light wavelength and intensity. However, beyond 10 d of growth, 14-3-3\u03bc-1 roots did not increase in greening as much as wild-type roots. This study reveals new developmental roles of 14-3-3 proteins in roots and chloroplasts, probably via association with the photosensory system.",

        "Abstract": "The 14-3-3 proteins have emerged as major phosphoprotein interaction proteins and thereby constitute a key node in the Arabidopsis Interactome Map, a node through which a large number of important signals pass. Throughout their history of discovery and description, the 14-3-3s have been described as protein families and there has been some evidence that the different 14-3-3 family members within any organism might carry isoform-specific functions. However, there has also been evidence for redundancy of 14-3-3 function, suggesting that the perceived 14-3-3 diversity may be the accumulation of neutral mutations over evolutionary time and as some 14-3-3 genes develop tissue or organ-specific expression. This situation has led to a currently unresolved question \u2013 does 14-3-3 isoform sequence diversity indicate functional diversity at the biochemical or cellular level? We discuss here some of the key observations on both sides of the resulting debate, and present a set of contrastable observations to address the theory functional diversity does exist among 14-3-3 isoforms. The resulting model suggests strongly that there are indeed functional specificities in the 14-3-3s of Arabidopsis. The model further suggests that 14-3-3 diversity and specificity should enter into the discussion of 14-3-3 roles in signal transduction and be directly approached in 14-3-3 experimentation. It is hoped that future studies involving 14-3-3s will continue to address specificity in experimental design and analysis.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundDuring medium- to long-duration spaceflights, real-time microgravity can increase the health risks of astronauts. In particular, the disruption of intestinal homeostasis is closely related to other health problems, and it is necessary to monitor related treatment strategies. Ginseng is a well-known Chinese herbal medicine often used to maintain health. Ginseng total saponins (GTSs), which are the bioactive components of ginseng, have been reported to regulate immune homeostasis, anti-inflammation, and anti-oxidation. This study focused on the regulation of GTSs in intestinal homeostasis imbalance caused by microgravity. MethodsA hindlimb suspension (HLS) rat model was established to evaluate the intestinal protective effects of GTSs. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using RNA-Seq. RT-PCR was performed to further focus and verify these results. The gut microbiome composition was examined based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and the short-chain fatty acids produced were further analyzed. ResultsWe found that GTSs intervention effectively improved the intestinal injury caused by simulated weightlessness, including reducing the pathological damage, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins and reducing the levels of inflammatory factors. Moreover, GTSs treatment significantly restored the levels of intestinal immunity-related genes and remodeled the gut microbiota. In particular, GTSs significantly increased the abundance of short-chain fatty acid metabolism-related bacteria, thereby increasing the level of propionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid. ConclusionOur results revealed that GTSs improved intestinal microecological disorders and impaired immune function caused by the weightlessness simulation. The underlying mechanism may be related to the \u201cintestinal immune -microbiota-metabolic\u201d pathway. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the precise design and development of GTSs for space-health products.",

        "Abstract": "Spaceflight presents a unique environment with complex stressors, including microgravity and radiation, that can influence plant physiology at molecular levels. Combining transcriptomics and proteomics approaches, this research gives insights into the coordination of transcriptome and proteome in Arabidopsis\u2019 molecular and physiological responses to Spaceflight environmental stress. Arabidopsis seedlings were germinated and grown in microgravity (\u00b5g) aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in NASA Biological Research in Canisters \u2013 Light Emitting Diode (BRIC LED) hardware, with the ground control established on Earth. At 10 days old, seedlings were frozen in RNA-later and returned to Earth. RNA-seq transcriptomics and TMT-labeled LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis of cellular fractionates from the plant tissues suggest the alteration of the photosynthetic machinery (PSII and PSI) in spaceflight, with the plant shifting photosystem core-regulatory proteins in an organ-specific manner to adapt to the microgravity environment. An overview of the ribosome, spliceosome, and proteasome activities in spaceflight revealed a significant abundance of transcripts and proteins involved in protease binding, nuclease activities, and mRNA binding in spaceflight, while those involved in tRNA binding, exoribonuclease activity, and RNA helicase activity were less abundant in spaceflight. CELLULOSE SYNTHASES (CESA1, CESA3, CESA5, CESA7) and CELLULOSE-LIKE PROTEINS (CSLE1, CSLG3), involved in cellulose deposition and TUBULIN COFACTOR B (TFCB) had reduced abundance in spaceflight. This contrasts with the increased expression of UDP-ARABINOPYRANOSE MUTASEs, involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides, in spaceflight. Both transcripts and proteome suggested an altered polar auxin redistribution, lipid, and ionic intracellular transportation in spaceflight. Analyses also suggest an increased metabolic energy requirement for plants in Space than on Earth, hence, the activation of several shunt metabolic pathways. This study provides novel insights, based on integrated RNA and protein data, on how plants adapt to the spaceflight environment and it is a step further at achieving sustainable crop production in Space.",

        "Abstract": "Plants have been recognized as key components of bioregenerative life support systems for space exploration, and many experiments have been carried out to evaluate their adaptability to spaceflight. Unfortunately, few of these experiments have involved monocot plants, which constitute most of the crops used on Earth as sources of food, feed, and fiber. To better understand the ability of monocot plants to adapt to spaceflight, we germinated and grew Brachypodium distachyon seedlings of the Bd21, Bd21-3, and Gaz8 accessions in a customized growth unit on the International Space Station, along with 1-g ground controls. At the end of a 4-day growth period, seedling organ\u2019s growth and morphologies were quantified, and root and shoot transcriptomic profiles were investigated using RNA-seq. The roots of all three accessions grew more slowly and displayed longer root hairs under microgravity conditions relative to ground control. On the other hand, the shoots of Bd21-3 and Gaz-8 grew at similar rates between conditions, whereas those of Bd21 grew more slowly under microgravity. The three Brachypodium accessions displayed dramatically different transcriptomic responses to microgravity relative to ground controls, with the largest numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) found in Gaz8 (4527), followed by Bd21 (1353) and Bd21-3 (570). Only 47 and six DEGs were shared between accessions for shoots and roots, respectively, including DEGs encoding wall-associated proteins and photosynthesis-related DEGs. Furthermore, DEGs associated with the \u201cOxidative Stress Response\u201d GO group were up-regulated in the shoots and down-regulated in the roots of Bd21 and Gaz8, indicating that Brachypodium roots and shoots deploy distinct biological strategies to adapt to the microgravity environment. A comparative analysis of the Brachypodium oxidative-stress response DEGs with the Arabidopsis ROS wheel suggests a connection between retrograde signaling, light response, and decreased expression of photosynthesis-related genes in microgravity-exposed shoots. In Gaz8, DEGs were also found to preferentially associate with the \u201cPlant Hormonal Signaling\u201d and \u201cMAP Kinase Signaling\u201d KEGG pathways. Overall, these data indicate that Brachypodium distachyon seedlings exposed to the microgravity environment of ISS display accession- and organ-specific responses that involve oxidative stress response, wall remodeling, photosynthesis inhibition, expression regulation, ribosome biogenesis, and post-translational modifications. The general characteristics of these responses are similar to those displayed by microgravity-exposed Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. However, organ- and accession-specific components of the response dramatically differ both within and between species. These results suggest a need to directly evaluate candidate-crop responses to microgravity to better understand their specific adaptability to this novel environment and develop cultivation strategies allowing them to strive during spaceflight.",

The possibility of using RNAlater-fixed materials for standard SEM-based morphometric investigation was explored to expand the library of tissues available for analysis and maximize usage of samples returned from spaceflight, but these technologies have wide application to any situation where recovery of biological resources is limited. \u2022 Methods and Results: RNAlater-fixed samples were desalinated in distilled water, dehydrated through graded methanol, plunged into liquid ethane, and transferred to cryovials for freeze-substitution. Sample tissues were critical point dried, mounted, sputter-coated, and imaged. \u2022 Conclusions: The protocol resulted in acceptable SEM images from RNAlater-fixed Arabidopsis thaliana tissue. The majority of the tissues remained intact, including general morphology and finer details such as root hairs and trichomes.",
        "Conclusion": "The protocol presented here provides distinct advantages for both spaceflight and ground-based experimental applications. Arabidopsis plants harvested on the International Space Station by astronauts were successfully retrieved from RNAlater and processed to produce acceptable quality images without the use of a dedicated morphologic fixative (Fig. 2J, K). Field studies may also benefit from the use of this protocol. As in spaceflight, the amount of materials able to be carried and used during an expedition is limited. With the option of using one stable, safe chemical fixative for all desired studies to be conducted upon return, scientists in the field may be able to collect more data with fewer trips. This protocol may also assist laboratories with libraries of samples in RNAlater by expanding the available techniques for study. Alternative imaging techniques outside the scope of this investigation provide alternatives to this protocol. True cryo-SEM would likely be an acceptable alternative (examples may be seen in Koroleva et al., 2010; Sarsby et al., 2012; and Yu et al., 2013), though desalination of specimens prior to tissue processing would still be beneficial. A second option is a cryo-holder, seen in Tang et al. (2012), which may prove to be an acceptable alternative step in this protocol if the SEM being used can handle the LN2 vapors. A third alternative is scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM; Marti et al., 1988; Hansma et al., 1989; Ushiki et al., 2012). Due to the high ionic content of RNAlater and the necessity for an ionic submersion liquid for SICM, it is possible that this instrument could generate comparable images without any tissue processing. This possibility was not tested due to lack of access to the necessary equipment. The protocol reported here will likely require optimization for each desired tissue to be tested. Arabidopsis is a very fragile tissue, with limited flat surfaces and small organ sizes. Other plants that may be more robust may tolerate a rougher technique, while more fragile tissues (i.e., floral tissues) may need a more gentle approach. Some potential additional steps to enhance tissue integrity include a postfixation step or reversing CPD and sputter-coating. A postfixation step (as seen in Behrendt et al., 2011), which would take place after the desalination, could improve tissue integrity during the cryo-analog plunge, especially if fixatives for electron microscopy, such as Karnovsky\u2019s or OsO4, are used. Sputter-coating prior to CPD (as seen in Yi et al., 2010) may also improve the physical tissue integrity, though both mounting prior to CPD and pulling a vacuum during the coating process may prove difficult. The use of this protocol provides more morphological opportunities for samples that would have previously been wasted due to improper fixation. It is designed to be a supplement to rather than a replacement of SEM standard practices. Although this process needs to be adapted to each sample being studied, it enhances flexibility in experiments when the main objective is not imaging.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract Scientific access to spaceflight and especially the International Space Station has revealed that physiological adaptation to spaceflight is accompanied or enabled by changes in gene expression that significantly alter the transcriptome of cells in spaceflight. A wide range of experiments have shown that plant physiological adaptation to spaceflight involves gene expression changes that alter cell wall and other metabolisms. However, while transcriptome profiling aptly illuminates changes in gene expression that accompany spaceflight adaptation, mutation analysis is required to illuminate key elements required for that adaptation. Here we report how transcriptome profiling was used to gain insight into the spaceflight adaptation role of Altered response to gravity 1 (Arg1), a gene known to affect gravity responses in plants on Earth. The study compared expression profiles of cultured lines of Arabidopsis thaliana derived from wild-type (WT) cultivar Col-0 to profiles from a knock-out line deficient in the gene encoding ARG1 (ARG1 KO), both on the ground and in space. The cell lines were launched on SpaceX CRS-2 as part of the Cellular Expression Logic (CEL) experiment of the BRIC-17 spaceflight mission. The cultured cell lines were grown within 60 mm Petri plates in Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs) that were housed within the Biological Research In Canisters (BRIC) hardware. Spaceflight samples were fixed on orbit. Differentially expressed genes were identified between the two environments (spaceflight and comparable ground controls) and the two genotypes (WT and ARG1 KO). Each genotype engaged unique genes during physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment, with little overlap. Most of the genes altered in expression in spaceflight in WT cells were found to be Arg1-dependent, suggesting a major role for that gene in the physiological adaptation of undifferentiated cells to spaceflight.

        "Abstract": "Abstract A feature of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) is the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated gene expression. The patterns of ROS-associated gene expression vary among Arabidopsis ecotypes, and the role of ROS signalling in spaceflight acclimation is unknown. What could differences in ROS gene regulation between ecotypes on orbit reveal about physiological adaptation to novel environments? Analyses of ecotype-dependent responses to spaceflight resulted in the elucidation of a previously uncharacterized gene (OMG1) as being ROS-associated. The OMG1 5\u2032 flanking region is an active promoter in cells where ROS activity is commonly observed, such as in pollen tubes, root hairs, and in other tissues upon wounding. qRT-PCR analyses revealed that upon wounding on Earth, OMG1 is an apparent transcriptional regulator of MYB77 and GRX480, which are associated with the ROS pathway. Fluorescence-based ROS assays show that OMG1 affects ROS production. Phylogenetic analysis of OMG1 and closely related homologs suggests that OMG1 is a distant, unrecognized member of the CONSTANS-Like protein family, a member that arose via gene duplication early in the angiosperm lineage and subsequently lost its first DNA-binding B-box1 domain. These data illustrate that members of the rapidly evolving COL protein family play a role in regulating ROS pathway functions, and their differential regulation on orbit suggests a role for ROS signalling in spaceflight physiological adaptation.",
        "Conclusion": "OMG1 is a CCT domain transcriptional regulator of ROS homeostasis, one that is important to the physiological adaptation of Arabidopsis ecotype WS to spaceflight. While investigations are underway to determine the detailed mechanisms of how OMG1 regulates the ROS homeostasis in wounding, and its specific role in spaceflight, the results presented here demonstrate several important concepts for general consideration. First, spaceflight experiments are useful platforms to discover novel gene functions and provide fundamental insights into terrestrial plant biology. Second, the response to spaceflight is genotype-specific and this understanding should be taken into consideration when defining the overall plant spaceflight response. WS and Col-0 differ in induction of OMG1 in spaceflight. Third, the maintenance of ROS homeostasis plays an important role as plants physiologically adapt to spaceflight. And, last, the CONSTANS-Like family contains members that function well beyond the clock and timing roles typically associated with CCT domains, including ROS signalling.",

        "Abstract": "Heat Shock Factor A2 (HsfA2) is part of the Heat Shock Factor (HSF) network, and plays an essential role beyond heat shock in environmental stress responses and cellular homeostatic control. Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures derived from wild type (WT) ecotype Col-0 and a knockout line deficient in the gene encoding HSFA2 (HSFA2 KO) were grown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to ascertain whether the HSF network functions in the adaptation to the novel environment of spaceflight. Microarray gene expression data were analyzed using a two-part comparative approach. First, genes differentially expressed between the two environments (spaceflight to ground) were identified within the same genotype, which represented physiological adaptation to spaceflight. Second, gene expression profiles were compared between the two genotypes (HSFA2 KO to WT) within the same environment, which defined genes uniquely required by each genotype on the ground and in spaceflight-adapted states. Results showed that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) define the HSFA2 KO cells\u2019 physiological state irrespective of the environment, and likely resulted from a deficiency in the chaperone-mediated protein folding machinery in the mutant. Results further suggested that additional to its universal stress response role, HsfA2 also has specific roles in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight through cell wall remodeling, signal perception and transduction, and starch biosynthesis. Disabling HsfA2 altered the physiological state of the cells, and impacted the mechanisms induced to adapt to spaceflight, and identified HsfA2-dependent genes that are important to the adaption of wild type cells to spaceflight. Collectively these data indicate a non-thermal role for the HSF network in spaceflight adaptation.",

To simulate microgravity using two well-established ground-based models, we cultured human whole blood-leukocytes in high-aspect rotating wall vessels (HARV-RWV) and used hindlimb unloaded (HU) mice. Both HARV-RWV simulation of leukocytes and HU-exposed mice showed elevated NLR profiles comparable to spaceflight exposed samples. To assess mechanisms involved, we found the simulated microgravity HARV-RWV model resulted in an imbalance of redox processes and activation of myeloperoxidase-producing inflammatory neutrophils, while antioxidant treatment reversed these effects. In the simulated microgravity HU model, mitochondrial catalase-transgenic mice that have reduced oxidative stress responses showed reduced neutrophil counts, NLR, and a dampened release of selective inflammatory cytokines compared to wildtype HU mice, suggesting simulated microgravity induced oxidative stress responses that triggered inflammation. In brief, both spaceflight and simulated microgravity models caused elevated NLR, indicating this as a potential biomarker for future in-flight immune health monitoring.",

This study assessed immune responses in mice following ground-based, simulated deep spaceflight conditions, compared with data from astronauts on International Space Station missions. For ground studies, we simulated microgravity using the hindlimb unloaded mouse model alone or in combination with acute simulated galactic cosmic rays or solar particle events irradiation. Immune profiling results revealed unique immune diversity following each experimental condition, suggesting each stressor results in distinct circulating immune responses, with clear consequences for deep spaceflight. Circulating plasma microRNA sequence analysis revealed involvement in immune system dysregulation. Furthermore, a large astronaut cohort showed elevated inflammation during low-Earth orbit missions, thereby supporting our simulated ground experiments in mice. Herein, circulating immune biomarkers are defined by distinct deep space irradiation types coupled to simulated microgravity and could be targets for future space health initiatives.",

Collected blood was profiled with a hematology analyzer and spleens were analyzed by whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-sequencing). The results revealed negligible differences in immune differentials. However, hematological system analyses of whole blood indicated large disparities in red blood cell differentials and morphology, suggestive of anemia. Murine Reactome networks indicated majority of spleen cells displayed differentially expressed genes (DEG) involved in signal transduction, metabolism, cell cycle, chromatin organization, and DNA repair. Although immune differentials were not changed, DEG analysis of the spleen revealed expression profiles associated with inflammation and dysregulated immune function persist to 1-week post-simulated spaceflight. Additionally, specific regulation pathways associated with human blood disease gene orthologs, such as blood pressure regulation, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 receptor signaling, and B cell differentiation were noted. Collectively, this study revealed differential immune and hematological outcomes 1-week post-simulated spaceflight conditions, suggesting recovery from spaceflight is an unremitting process.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Plants subjected to the novel environment of spaceflight show transcriptomic changes that resemble aspects of several terrestrial abiotic stress responses. Under investigation here is whether epigenetic modulations, similar to those that occur in terrestrial stress responses, have a functional role in spaceflight physiological adaptation. The Advanced Plant Experiment-04 \u2013 Epigenetic Expression experiment examined the role of cytosine methylation in spaceflight adaptation. The experiment was conducted onboard the International Space Station, and evaluated the spaceflight-altered, genome-wide methylation profiles of two methylation-regulating gene mutants [methyltransferase 1 (met1-7) and elongator complex subunit 2 (elp2-5)] along with a wild-type Col-0 control. Results: The elp2-5 plants suffered in their physiological adaptation to spaceflight in that their roots failed to extend away from the seed and the overall development of the plants was greatly impaired in space. The met1-7 plants suffered less, with their morphology affected by spaceflight in a manner similar to that of the Col-0 controls. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in spaceflight were dramatically different in the elp2-5 and met1-7 plants compared to Col-0, indicating that the disruptions in these mutants resulted in a reprogramming of their spaceflight responses, especially in elp2-5. Many of the genes comprising the spaceflight transcriptome of each genotype were differentially methylated in spaceflight. In Col-0 the majority of the DEGs were representative of the now familiar spaceflight response, which includes genes associated with cell wall remodeling, pathogen responses and ROS signaling. However, the spaceflight transcriptomes of met1-7 and elp2-5 each presented patterns of DEGs that are almost completely different than Col-0, and to each other. Further, the DEGs of the mutant genotypes suggest a more severe spaceflight stress response in the mutants, particularly in elp2-5. Conclusion: Arabidopsis physiological adaptation to spaceflight results in differential DNA methylation in an organ-specific manner. Disruption of Met1 methyltransferase function does not dramatically affect spaceflight growth or morphology, yet met1-7 reprograms the spaceflight transcriptomic response in a unique manner. Disruption of elp2-5 results in poor development in spaceflight grown plants, together with a diminished, dramatically reprogrammed transcriptomic response.",
        "Conclusion": "Genetic factors that influence genome DNA methylation directly impact physiological adaptation to spaceflight, affecting overall growth in space as well as the specifics of the spaceflight gene response profile. Genome methylation is therefore important for spaceflight responses in much the same way as it is important for adaptation to terrestrial stresses. In particular, processes regulated by ELP2 appear critical for proper root directional development in spaceflight. The remodeling of the Arabidopsis methylome in spaceflight, together with the negative outcomes of interfering with DNA methylation, suggests that epigenetic marking is a fundamental part of environmental responses, even during novel environmental stresses outside of the evolutionary history of plants.",

Using samples from Apollo 11, 12, and 17, we show that the terrestrial plant Arabidopsis thaliana germinates and grows in diverse lunar regoliths. However, our results show that growth is challenging; the lunar regolith plants were slow to develop and many showed severe stress morphologies. Moreover, all plants grown in lunar soils differentially expressed genes indicating ionic stresses, similar to plant reactions to salt, metal and reactive oxygen species. Therefore, although in situ lunar regoliths can be useful for plant production in lunar habitats, they are not benign substrates. The interaction between plants and lunar regolith will need to be further elucidated, and likely mitigated, to best enable efficient use of lunar regolith for life support within lunar stations.",

We report CNS changes in Drosophila aboard the International Space Station in response to microgravity (SF\u03bcg) and artificially simulated Earth gravity (SF1g) via inflight centrifugation as a countermeasure. While inflight behavioral analyses of SF\u03bcg exhibit increased activity, postflight analysis displays significant climbing defects, highlighting the sensitivity of behavior to altered gravity. Multi-omics analysis shows alterations in metabolic, oxidative stress, and synaptic transmission pathways in both SF\u03bcg and SF1g; however, neurological changes immediately postflight, including neuronal loss, glial cell count alterations, oxidative damage, and apoptosis, are seen only in SF\u03bcg. Additionally, progressive neuronal loss and a glial phenotype in SF1g and SF\u03bcg brains, with pronounced phenotypes in SF\u03bcg, are seen upon acclimation to Earth conditions. Overall, our results indicate that artificial gravity partially protects the CNS from the adverse effects of spaceflight.",

Here, we discuss a method utilizing KSC Fixation Tubes (KFTs) to both carry biology to suborbital space as well as fix that biology at certain stages of flight. Plants on support media were inserted into the sample side of KFTs preloaded with RNAlater in the fixation chamber. The KFTs were activated at various stages of a simulated flight to fix the plants. RNA-seq analysis conducted on tissue samples housed in KFTs, showed that plants behaved consistently in KFTs when compared to petri-plates. Over the time course, roots adjusted to hypoxia and leaves adjusted to changes in photosynthesis. These responses were due in part to the environment imposed by the encased triple containment of the KFTs, which is a requirement for flight in human spacecraft. While plants exhibited expected reproducible transcriptomic alteration over time in the KFTs, responses to clinorotation during the simulated flight suggest that transcriptomic responses to suborbital spaceflight can be examined using this approach.",

        "Abstract": "Alterations in immune function have been documented during or post-spaceflight and in ground based models of microgravity. Identification of immune parameters that are dysregulated during spaceflight is an important step in mitigating crew health risks during deep space missions. The in vitro analysis of leukocyte activity post-spaceflight in both human and animal species is primarily focused on lymphocytic function. This report completes a broader spectrum analysis of mouse lymphocyte and monocyte changes post 13 days orbital flight (mission STS-135). Analysis includes an examination in surface markers for cell activation, and antigen presentation and co-stimulatory molecules. Cytokine production was measured after stimulation with T-cell mitogen or TLR-2, TLR-4, or TLR-5 agonists. Splenocyte surface marker analysis immediate post-spaceflight and after in vitro culture demonstrated unique changes in phenotypic populations between the flight mice and matched treatment ground controls. Post-spaceflight splenocytes (flight splenocytes) had lower expression intensity of CD4+CD25+ and CD8+CD25+ cells, lower percentage of CD11c+MHC II+ cells, and higher percentage of CD11c+MHC I+ populations compared to ground controls. The flight splenocytes demonstrated an increase in phagocytic activity. Stimulation with ConA led to decrease in CD4+ population but increased CD4+CD25+ cells compared to ground controls. Culturing with TLR agonists led to a decrease in CD11c+ population in splenocytes isolated from flight mice compared to ground controls. Consequently, flight splenocytes with or without TLR-agonist stimulation showed a decrease in CD11c+MHC I+, CD11c+MHC II+, and CD11c+CD86+ cells compared to ground controls. Production of IFN-\u03b3 was decreased and IL-2 was increased from ConA stimulated flight splenocytes. This study demonstrated that expression of surface molecules can be affected by conditions of spaceflight and impaired responsiveness persists under culture conditions in vitro.",

This study evaluated C57BL/6 mice on Day 40 after total-body 56Fe26+ irradiation at 0, 1, 2 and 3 gray (Gy). Radiation consistently increased thymus mass (one-way ANOVA: P < 0.005); spleen, liver and lung masses were similar among all groups. In the blood, there was no radiation effect on the white blood cell (WBC) count or major leukocyte types. However, the red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit and the CD8+ T cytotoxic (Tc) cell count and percentage all decreased, while both the CD4:CD8 (Th:Tc) cell ratio and spontaneous blastogenesis increased, in one or more irradiated groups compared with unirradiated controls (P < 0.05 vs 0 Gy). In contrast, splenic WBC, lymphocyte, B cell and T helper (Th) counts, %B cells and the CD4:CD8 ratio were all significantly elevated, while Tc percentages decreased, in one or more of the irradiated groups compared with controls (P < 0.05 vs 0 Gy). Although there were trends for minor, radiation-induced increases in %CD11b+ granulocytes in the spleen, cells double-labeled with adhesion markers (CD11b+CD54+, CD11b+CD62E+) were normal. Splenocyte spontaneous blastogenesis and that induced by mitogens (PHA, ConA, LPS) was equivalent to normal. In bone marrow, the percentage of cells expressing stem cell markers, Sca-1 and CD34/Sca-1, were low in one or more of the irradiated groups (P < 0.05 vs 0 Gy). Collectively, the data indicate that significant immunological abnormalities still exist more than a month after 56Fe irradiation and that there are differences dependent upon body compartment.",

        "Abstract": "The Space Shuttle Atlantis launched on its final mission (STS-135) on July 8, 2011. After just under 13 days, the shuttle landed safely at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for the last time. Female C57BL/6J mice flew as part of the Commercial Biomedical Testing Module-3 (CBTM-3) payload. Ground controls were maintained at the KSC facility. Subsets of these mice were made available to investigators as part of NASA\u2019s Bio-specimen Sharing Program (BSP). Our group characterized cell phenotype distributions and phagocytic function in the spleen, catecholamine and corticosterone levels in the adrenal glands, and transcriptomics/metabolomics in the liver. Despite decreases in most splenic leukocyte subsets, there were increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related activity. Although there were increases noted in corticosterone levels in both the adrenals and liver, there were no significant changes in catecholamine levels. Furthermore, functional analysis of gene expression and metabolomic profiles suggest that the functional changes are not due to oxidative or psychological stress. Despite changes in gene expression patterns indicative of increases in phagocytic activity (e.g. endocytosis and formation of peroxisomes), there was no corresponding increase in genes related to ROS metabolism. In contrast, there were increases in expression profiles related to fatty acid oxidation with decreases in glycolysis-related profiles. Given the clear link between immune function and metabolism in many ground-based diseases, we propose a similar link may be involved in spaceflight-induced decrements in immune and metabolic function.",

Enrichment analyses of metabolite and gene sets showed significant changes in osmolyte concentrations and pathways related to glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism, likely consequences of relative dehydration of the spaceflight mice. However, we also found increased enrichment of aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and purine metabolic pathways, concomitant with enrichment of genes associated with autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome. When taken together with a downregulation in nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2-mediated signaling, our analyses suggest that decreased hepatic oxidative defense may lead to aberrant tRNA post-translational processing, induction of degradation programs and senescence-associated mitochondrial dysfunction in response to the spaceflight environment.",

        "Abstract": "While many efforts have been made to pave the way toward human space colonization, little consideration has been given to the methods of protecting spacefarers against harsh cosmic and local radioactive environments and the high costs associated with protection from the deleterious physiological effects of exposure to high-Linear energy transfer (high-LET) radiation. Herein, we lay the foundations of a roadmap toward enhancing human radioresistance for the purposes of deep space colonization and exploration. We outline future research directions toward the goal of enhancing human radioresistance, including upregulation of endogenous repair and radioprotective mechanisms, possible leeways into gene therapy in order to enhance radioresistance via the translation of exogenous and engineered DNA repair and radioprotective mechanisms, the substitution of organic molecules with fortified isoforms, and methods of slowing metabolic activity while preserving cognitive function. We conclude by presenting the known associations between radioresistance and longevity, and articulating the position that enhancing human radioresistance is likely to extend the healthspan of human spacefarers as well.",
        "Conclusion": "We have outlined several alternative and complementary strategies for enhancing human radioresistance for the purposes of deep space exploration and colonization using existing biomedical and biotechnological tools and modalities in an attempt to lay the foundation for a comprehensive roadmap towards highly radioresistant humans. While many of the strategies proposed above may seem speculative, they should be considered as a foundation for future research directions. Meanwhile, we have highlighted the link between radioresistance and aging, and have endeavored to show how many of the biomedical and biotechnological modalities discussed in the present review could combinatorially be applied to both enhancing human radioresistance on the one hand and healthy longevity on the other. We also highlighted the need to converge and accelerate the research in radiobiology, biogerontology and AI to enable spacefarers to address the healthcare challenges we may not yet be aware of. Furthermore, given the massive amount of funding allocated to research into facilitating and optimizing space exploration and optimization, we hope to have shown how research into enhancing radioresistance for space exploration could galvanize progress in human healthspan extension, an area of research that is still massively underfunded despite its potential to prevent the massive economic burden posed by the future healthcare costs associated with demographic aging.",

To explore possible mechanisms, the proteomic changes following spaceflight in mouse brain were characterized. Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) was launched from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on a 13-day mission. Within 3\u20135 h after landing, brain tissue was collected to evaluate protein expression profiles using quantitative proteomic analysis. Our results showed that there were 26 proteins that were significantly altered after spaceflight in the gray and/or white matter. While there was no overlap between the white and gray matter in terms of individual proteins, there was overlap in terms of function, synaptic plasticity, vesical activity, protein/organelle transport, and metabolism. Our data demonstrate that exposure to the spaceflight environment induces significant changes in protein expression related to neuronal structure and metabolic function. This might lead to a significant impact on brain structural and functional integrity that could affect the outcome of space missions.",

Multiple organ systems are affected by microgravity and radiation, including the cardiovascular system. Previous transcriptomic studies have sought to reveal the changes in gene expression after spaceflight. However, little is known about the impact of long-term spaceflight on the mouse heart in vivo. This study focuses on the transcriptomic changes in the hearts of female C57BL/6J mice flown on the International Space Station (ISS) for 30 days. RNA was isolated from the hearts of three flight and three comparable ground control mice and RNA sequencing was performed. Our analyses showed that 1147 transcripts were significantly regulated after spaceflight. The MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and GPCR signaling pathways were predicted to be activated. Transcripts related to cytoskeleton breakdown and organization were upregulated, but no significant change in the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) components or oxidative stress pathway-associated transcripts occurred. Our results indicate an absence of cellular senescence, and a significant upregulation of transcripts associated with the cell cycle. Transcripts related to cellular maintenance and survival were most affected by spaceflight, suggesting that cardiovascular transcriptome initiates an adaptive response to long-term spaceflight.",

While little is known about how spaceflight affects transcription spatially in the brain, a greater understanding of this process has the potential to aid strategies that mitigate the effects of spaceflight on the brain. Therefore, we performed GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling of mouse brains subjected to either spaceflight or grounded controls. Four brain regions were selected: Cortex, Frontal Cortex, Corunu Ammonis I, and Dentate Gyrus. Antioxidants have emerged as a potential means of attenuating the effects of spaceflight, so we treated a subset of the mice with a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE). Our analysis revealed hundreds of differentially expressed genes due to spaceflight in each of the four brain regions. Both common and region-specific transcriptomic responses were observed. Metabolic pathways and pathways sensitive to oxidative stress were enriched in the four brain regions due to spaceflight. These findings enhance our understanding of brain regional variation in susceptibility to spaceflight conditions. BuOE reduced the transcriptomic effects of spaceflight at a large number of genes, suggesting that this compound may attenuate oxidative stress-induced brain damage caused by the spaceflight environment.",

We identified 50 PERK genes in Brassica napus to explore their evolutionary dynamics, structural diversity, and functional roles. These genes were grouped into four classes and unevenly distributed across 18 chromosomes. Phylogenetic studies and Ka/Ks ratios revealed purifying selection during the evolution process. They exhibited significant diversification in gene length, molecular weight, and isoelectric points, suggesting specialized function. Gene structure and motif analyses revealed variations among the BnPERK family members, with conserved tyrosine kinase domains suggesting functional importance. Cis-element analysis predicted the involvement in hormone signaling and stress responses. Expression profiling showed diverse patterns across tissues and hormone treatments, highlighting potential roles in growth regulation and hormone signaling. Protein\u2013protein interaction networks suggested BnPERK proteins interact with a wide array of proteins, implicating them in multiple biological processes. The transcriptional downregulation of four BnPERK genes upon Plasmodiophora brassicae infection implied a role in clubroot disease response. Furthermore, the Arabidopsis perk9 mutant displayed relieved disease severity and enhanced basal immune response, suggesting the negative role of PERK9 in plant immunity. The study highlighted the potential role of BnPERKs in crop improvement strategies against clubroot disease.",

        "Abstract": "The phosphoinositide pathway and inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3) have been implicated in plant responses to many abiotic stresses; however, their role in response to biotic stress is not well characterized. In the current study, we show that both basal defense and systemic acquired resistance responses are affected in transgenic plants constitutively expressing the human type I inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (InsP 5-ptase) which have greatly reduced InsP3 levels. Flagellin induced Ca2+-release as well as the expressions of some flg22 responsive genes were attenuated in the InsP 5-ptase plants. Furthermore, the InsP 5-ptase plants were more susceptible to virulent and avirulent strains of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000. The InsP 5-ptase plants had lower basal salicylic acid (SA) levels and the induction of SAR in systemic leaves was reduced and delayed. Reciprocal exudate experiments showed that although the InsP 5-ptase plants produced equally effective molecules that could trigger PR-1 gene expression in wild type plants, exudates collected from either wild type or InsP 5-ptase plants triggered less PR-1 gene expression in InsP 5-ptase plants. Additionally, expression profiles indicated that several defense genes including PR-1, PR-2, PR-5, and AIG1 were basally down regulated in the InsP 5-ptase plants compared with wild type. Upon pathogen attack, expression of these genes was either not induced or showed delayed induction in systemic leaves. Our study shows that phosphoinositide signaling is one component of the plant defense network and is involved in both basal and systemic responses. The dampening of InsP3-mediated signaling affects Ca2+ release, modulates defense gene expression and compromises plant defense responses.",

Understanding plant responses to fractional gravity is relevant for plant growth on lunar and Martian surfaces. The plant signaling flight experiment utilized the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) onboard the International Space Station (ISS). The EMCS consisted of two rotors within a controlled chamber allowing for two experimental conditions, microgravity (stationary rotor) and simulated gravity in space. Seedlings were grown for 5 days under continuous light in seed cassettes. The arrangement of the seed cassettes within each experimental container results in a gradient of fractional g (in the spinning rotor). To investigate whether gene expression patterns are sensitive to fractional g, we carried out transcriptional profiling of root samples exposed to microgravity or partial g (ranging from 0.53 to 0.88 g). Data were analyzed using DESeq2 with fractional g as a continuous variable in the design model in order to query gene expression across the gravity continuum. We identified a subset of genes whose expression correlates with changes in fractional g. Interestingly, the most responsive genes include those encoding transcription factors, defense, and cell wall-related proteins and heat shock proteins.",

        "Abstract": "IntroductionUnderstanding how plants adapt to the space environment is essential, as plants will be a valuable component of long duration space missions. Several spaceflight experiments have focused on transcriptional profiling as a means of understanding plant adaptation to microgravity. However, there is limited overlap between results from different experiments. Differences in experimental conditions and hardware make it difficult to find a consistent response across experiments and to distinguish the primary effects of microgravity from other spaceflight effects. MethodsPlant Signaling (PS) and Plant RNA Regulation (PRR) were two separate spaceflight experiments conducted on the International Space Station utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS). The EMCS provided a lighted environment for plant growth with centrifugal capabilities providing an onboard 1 g control. Results and discussionAn RNA-Seq analysis of shoot samples from PS and PRR revealed a significant overlap of genes differentially expressed in microgravity between the two experiments. Relative to onboard 1 g controls, genes involved in transcriptional regulation, shoot development, and response to auxin and light were upregulated in microgravity in both experiments. Conversely, genes involved in defense response, abiotic stress, Ca++ signaling, and cell wall modification were commonly downregulated in both datasets. The downregulation of stress responses in microgravity in these two experiments is interesting as these pathways have been previously observed as upregulated in spaceflight compared to ground controls. Similarly, we have observed many stress response genes to be upregulated in the 1 g onboard control compared to ground reference controls; however these genes were specifically downregulated in microgravity. In addition, we analyzed the sRNA landscape of the 1 g and microgravity (\u03bc g) shoot samples from PRR. We identified three miRNAs (miR319c, miR398b, and miR8683) which were upregulated in microgravity, while several of their corresponding target genes were found to be downregulated in microgravity. Interestingly, the downregulated target genes are enriched in those encoding chloroplast-localized enzymes and proteins. These results uncover microgravity unique transcriptional changes and highlight the validity and importance of an onboard 1 g control.",

Sample collection under such difficult conditions introduces confounding factors that need to be identified and addressed. We found large changes in the transcriptome of mouse tissues dissected and preserved on-orbit compared with tissues from mice euthanized on-orbit, preserved, and dissected after return to Earth. Changes due to preservation method eclipsed those between flight and ground samples, making it difficult to identify spaceflight-specific changes. Follow-on experiments to interrogate the roles of euthanasia methods, tissue and carcass preservation protocols, and library preparation methods suggested that differences due to preservation protocols are exacerbated when coupled with polyA selection. This has important implications for the interpretation of existing datasets and the design of future experiments.",

Methodology/Principal FindingsIn terrestrial gastropod snail we studied the impact of 16- (Foton M-2) and 12-day (Foton M-3) exposure to microgravity in unmanned orbital missions on: (i) the whole animal behavior (Helix lucorum L.), (ii) the statoreceptor responses to tilt in an isolated neural preparation (Helix lucorum L.), and (iii) the differential expression of the Helix pedal peptide (HPep) and the tetrapeptide FMRFamide genes in neural structures (Helix aspersa L.). Experiments were performed 13\u201342 hours after return to Earth. Latency of body re-orientation to sudden 90\u00b0 head-down pitch was significantly reduced in postflight snails indicating an enhanced negative gravitaxis response. Statoreceptor responses to tilt in postflight snails were independent of motion direction, in contrast to a directional preference observed in control animals. Positive relation between tilt velocity and firing rate was observed in both control and postflight snails, but the response magnitude was significantly larger in postflight snails indicating an enhanced sensitivity to acceleration. A significant increase in mRNA expression of the gene encoding HPep, a peptide linked to ciliary beating, in statoreceptors was observed in postflight snails; no differential expression of the gene encoding FMRFamide, a possible neurotransmission modulator, was observed. Conclusions/SignificanceUpregulation of statocyst function in snails following microgravity exposure parallels that observed in vertebrates suggesting fundamental principles underlie gravi-sensing and the organism's ability to adapt to gravity changes. This simple animal model offers the possibility to describe general subcellular mechanisms of nervous system's response to conditions on Earth and in space.",

        "Abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells are an important first-line of defense against malignant cells. Because of the potential for increased cancer risk from astronaut exposure to space radiation, we determined whether microgravity present during spaceflight affects the body\u2019s defenses against leukemogenesis. Human NK cells were cultured for 48 h under normal gravity and simulated microgravity (s\u03bcG), and cytotoxicity against K-562 (CML) and MOLT-4 (T-ALL) cells was measured using standard methodology or under continuous s\u03bcG. This brief exposure to s\u03bcG markedly reduced NK cytotoxicity against both leukemias, and these deleterious effects were more pronounced in continuous s\u03bcG. RNA-seq performed on NK cells from two additional healthy donors provided insight into the mechanism(s) by which s\u03bcG reduced cytotoxicity. Given our prior report of space radiation-induced human T-ALL in vivo, the reduced cytotoxicity against MOLT-4 is striking and raises the possibility that \u03bcG may increase astronaut risk of leukemogenesis during prolonged missions beyond LEO.",

        "Abstract": "Lab-on-a-chip (LOC) applications in environmental, biomedical, agricultural, biological, and spaceflight research require an ion-selective electrode (ISE) that can withstand prolonged storage in complex biological media 1-4. An all-solid-state ion-selective-electrode (ASSISE) is especially attractive for the aforementioned applications. The electrode should have the following favorable characteristics: easy construction, low maintenance, and (potential for) miniaturization, allowing for batch processing. A microfabricated ASSISE intended for quantifying H+, Ca2+, and CO32- ions was constructed. It consists of a noble-metal electrode layer (i.e. Pt), a transduction layer, and an ion-selective membrane (ISM) layer. The transduction layer functions to transduce the concentration-dependent chemical potential of the ion-selective membrane into a measurable electrical signal. The lifetime of an ASSISE is found to depend on maintaining the potential at the conductive layer/membrane interface 5-7. To extend the ASSISE working lifetime and thereby maintain stable potentials at the interfacial layers, we utilized the conductive polymer (CP) poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) 7-9 in place of silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) as the transducer layer. We constructed the ASSISE in a lab-on-a-chip format, which we called the multi-analyte biochip (MAB) (Figure 1). Calibrations in test solutions demonstrated that the MAB can monitor pH (operational range pH 4-9), CO32- (measured range 0.01 mM - 1 mM), and Ca2+ (log-linear range 0.01 mM to 1 mM). The MAB for pH provides a near-Nernstian slope response after almost one month storage in algal medium. The carbonate biochips show a potentiometric profile similar to that of a conventional ion-selective electrode. Physiological measurements were employed to monitor biological activity of the model system, the microalga Chlorella vulgaris. The MAB conveys an advantage in size, versatility, and multiplexed analyte sensing capability, making it applicable to many confined monitoring situations, on Earth or in space. Biochip Design and Experimental MethodsThe biochip is 10 x 11 mm in dimension and has 9 ASSISEs designated as working electrodes (WEs) and 5 Ag/AgCl reference electrodes (REs). Each working electrode (WE) is 240 \u03bcm in diameter and is equally spaced at 1.4 mm from the REs, which are 480 \u03bcm in diameter. These electrodes are connected to electrical contact pads with a dimension of 0.5 mm x 0.5 mm. The schematic is shown in Figure 2.Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic deposition methods are used to electropolymerize the PEDOT films using a Bioanalytical Systems Inc. (BASI) C3 cell stand (Figure 3). The counter-ion for the PEDOT film is tailored to suit the analyte ion of interest. A PEDOT with poly(styrenesulfonate) counter ion (PEDOT/PSS) is utilized for H+ and CO32-, while one with sulphate (added to the solution as CaSO4) is utilized for Ca2+. The electrochemical properties of the PEDOT-coated WE is analyzed using CVs in redox-active solution (i.e. 2 mM potassium ferricyanide (K3Fe(CN)6)). Based on the CV profile, Randles-Sevcik analysis was used to determine the effective surface area 10. Spin-coating at 1,500 rpm is used to cast ~2 \u03bcm thick ion-selective membranes (ISMs) on the MAB working electrodes (WEs).The MAB is contained in a microfluidic flow-cell chamber filled with a 150 \u03bcl volume of algal medium; the contact pads are electrically connected to the BASI system (Figure 4). The photosynthetic activity of Chlorella vulgaris is monitored in ambient light and dark conditions.",

        "Abstract": "The space race is entering a new era of exploration, in which the number of robotic and human missions to various places in our solar system is rapidly increasing. Despite the recent advances in propulsion and life support technologies, there is a growing need to perform analytical measurements and laboratory experiments across diverse domains of science, while keeping low payload requirements. In this context, lab-on-a-chip nanobiosensors appear to be an emerging technology capable of revolutionizing space exploration, given their low footprint, high accuracy, and low payload requirements. To date, only some approaches for monitoring astronaut health in spacecraft environments have been reported. Although non-invasive molecular diagnostics, like lab-on-a-chip technology, are expected to improve the quality of long-term space missions, their application to monitor microbiological and environmental variables is rarely reported, even for analogous extreme environments on Earth. The possibility of evaluating the occurrence of unknown or unexpected species, identifying redox gradients relevant to microbial metabolism, or testing for specific possible biosignatures, will play a key role in the future of space microbiology. In this review, we will examine the current and potential roles of lab-on-a-chip technology in space exploration and in extreme environment investigation, reporting what has been tested so far, and clarifying the direction toward which the newly developed technologies of portable lab-on-a-chip sensors are heading for exploration in extreme environments and in space.",
        "Conclusion": "5.  One of the main goals of space research is to extend the human experience to the farthest reaches of space to discover, explore, and exploit uncharted regions of space. However, life in space continues to bring new insights into human physiology and psychology that may lead to the failure of current detection systems (Krishen, 2009). Radiation, plasma, atomic oxygen, outgassing, and contamination can drastically limit the life of a space flight and seriously affect the success of a project. Accurate, precise, efficient, and cost-effective health monitoring is consistently important. Biosensor systems are reported to be good analyzers for chemical substance measurements (Haney et al., 2020). However, the combination of many harsh conditions creates significant difficulties for the development of suitable instruments. Lightness, compressibility, self-healing, radiation, micrometeoroids, and orbital debris resistance would be all desirable features in sensors design. In this perspective, LoC-based sensors represent the best choice among the finest detection systems able to detect and respond to harsh situations. They can be optical fibers, nanosensors, or vibration sensors in combination with artificial intelligence and telemetry. Microfluidic technology is a good example and the best way to accelerate processes in science and industry today, and it will soon transform the entire industry (Krishen, 2009; Hessel et al., 2020). In this review, currently used systems for detection of analytes in extreme environments and space exploration were discussed, suggesting PoC and LoC approaches represent the best choice. They ensure accurate and continuous monitoring of the analytes, without sacrificing selectivity or sensitivity. However, new advances in the fields of engineering, nanomaterials and electronics can improve durability, reversibility, sensitivity, and selectivity of the analytical devices, supporting the development of next-generation systems suitable for harsh environment investigation and space exploration.",

        "Abstract": "The first genome sequenced of a eukaryotic organism was for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as reported in 1996, but it was more than 10 years before any of the zygomycete fungi, which are the early-diverging terrestrial fungi currently placed in the phyla Mucoromycota and Zoopagomycota, were sequenced. The genome for Rhizopus delemar was completed in 2008; currently, more than 1000 zygomycete genomes have been sequenced. Genomic data from these early-diverging terrestrial fungi revealed deep phylogenetic separation of the two major clades\u2014primarily plant\u2014associated saprotrophic and mycorrhizal Mucoromycota versus the primarily mycoparasitic or animal-associated parasites and commensals in the Zoopagomycota. Genomic studies provide many valuable insights into how these fungi evolved in response to the challenges of living on land, including adaptations to sensing light and gravity, development of hyphal growth, and co-existence with the first terrestrial plants. Genome sequence data have facilitated studies of genome architecture, including a history of genome duplications and horizontal gene transfer events, distribution and organization of mating type loci, rDNA genes and transposable elements, methylation processes, and genes useful for various industrial applications. Pathogenicity genes and specialized secondary metabolites have also been detected in soil saprobes and pathogenic fungi. Novel endosymbiotic bacteria and viruses have been discovered during several zygomycete genome projects. Overall, genomic information has helped to resolve a plethora of research questions, from the placement of zygomycetes on the evolutionary tree of life and in natural ecosystems, to the applied biotechnological and medical questions.",

        "Abstract": "The motion of cells orthogonal to the direction of main flow is of importance in natural and engineered systems. The lateral movement of red blood cells (RBCs) distal to sudden expansion is considered to influence the formation and progression of thrombosis in venous valves, aortic aneurysms, and blood-circulating devices and is also a determining parameter for cell separation applications in flow-focusing microfluidic devices. Although it is known that the unique geometry of venous valves alters the blood flow patterns and cell distribution in venous valve sinuses, the interactions between fluid flow and RBCs have not been elucidated. Here, using a dilute cell suspension in an in vitro microfluidic model of a venous valve, we quantified the spatial distribution of RBCs by microscopy and image analysis, and using micro-particle image velocimetry and 3D computational fluid dynamics simulations, we analyzed the complex flow patterns. The results show that the local hematocrit in the valve pockets is spatially heterogeneous and is significantly different from the feed hematocrit. Above a threshold shear rate, the inertial separation of streamlines and lift forces contribute to an uneven distribution of RBCs in the vortices, the entrapment of RBCs in the vortices, and non-monotonic wall shear stresses in the valve pockets. Our experimental and computational characterization provides insights into the complex interactions between fluid flow, RBC distribution, and wall shear rates in venous valve mimics, which is of relevance to understanding the pathophysiology of thrombosis and improving cell separation efficiency.",

        "Abstract": "Bioinformatics approaches have proven useful in understanding biological responses to spaceflight. Spaceflight experiments remain resource intensive and rare. One outstanding issue is how to maximize scientific output from a limited number of omics datasets from traditional animal models including nematodes, fruitfly, and rodents. The utility of omics data from invertebrate models in anticipating mammalian responses to spaceflight has not been fully explored. Hence, we performed comparative analyses of transcriptomes of soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) in mice that underwent 37 days of spaceflight. Results indicate shared stress responses and altered circadian rhythm. EDL showed more robust growth signals and Pde2a downregulation, possibly underlying its resistance to atrophy versus soleus. Spaceflight and hindlimb unloading mice shared differential regulation of proliferation, circadian, and neuronal signaling. Shared gene regulation in muscles of humans on bedrest and space flown rodents suggest targets for mitigating muscle atrophy in space and on Earth. Spaceflight responses of C. elegans were more similar to EDL. Discrete life stages of D. melanogaster have distinct utility in anticipating EDL and soleus responses. In summary, spaceflight leads to shared and discrete molecular responses between muscle types and invertebrate models may augment mechanistic knowledge gained from rodent spaceflight and ground-based studies.",

        "Abstract": "Astronauts have been previously shown to exhibit decreased salivary lysozyme and increased dental calculus and gingival inflammation in response to space flight, host factors that could contribute to oral diseases such as caries and periodontitis. However, the specific physiological response of caries-causing bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans to space flight and/or ground-based simulated microgravity has not been extensively investigated. In this study, high aspect ratio vessel S. mutans simulated microgravity and normal gravity cultures were assessed for changes in metabolite and transcriptome profiles, H2O2 resistance, and competence in sucrose-containing biofilm media. Stationary phase S. mutans simulated microgravity cultures displayed increased killing by H2O2 compared to normal gravity control cultures, but competence was not affected. RNA-seq analysis revealed that expression of 153 genes was up-regulated \u22652-fold and 94 genes down-regulated \u22652-fold during simulated microgravity high aspect ratio vessel growth. These included a number of genes located on extrachromosomal elements, as well as genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, translation, and stress responses. Collectively, these results suggest that growth under microgravity analog conditions promotes changes in S. mutans gene expression and physiology that may translate to an altered cariogenic potential of this organism during space flight missions.",

This experiment used Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs) to grow asynchronous ground control and spaceflight cultures of S. aureus for 48 h. RNAIII, the effector of the Accessory Gene Regulator (Agr) quorum sensing system, was the most highly upregulated gene transcript in spaceflight relative to ground controls. The agr operon gene transcripts were also highly upregulated during spaceflight, followed by genes encoding phenol-soluble modulins and secreted proteases, which are positively regulated by Agr. Upregulated spaceflight genes/proteins also had functions related to urease activity, type VII-like Ess secretion, and copper transport. We also performed secretome analysis of BRIC-23 culture supernatants, which revealed that spaceflight samples had increased abundance of secreted virulence factors, including Agr-regulated proteases (SspA, SspB), staphylococcal nuclease (Nuc), and EsxA (secreted by the Ess system). These data also indicated that S. aureus metabolism is altered in spaceflight conditions relative to the ground controls. Collectively, these data suggest that S. aureus experiences increased quorum sensing and altered expression of virulence factors in response to the spaceflight environment that may impact its pathogenic potential.",

        "Abstract": "Vacuoles are dynamic compartments with constant fluctuations and transient structures such as trans-vacuolar strands and bulbs. Bulbs are highly dynamic spherical structures inside vacuoles that are formed by multiple layers of membranes and are continuous with the main tonoplast. We recently carried out a screen for mutants with abnormal trafficking to the vacuole or aberrant vacuole morphology. We characterized regulator of bulb biogenesis1-1 (rbb1-1), a mutant in Arabidopsis that contains increased numbers of bulbs when compared to the parental control. rbb1-1 mutants also contain fewer transvacuolar strands than the parental control, and we propose the hypothesis that the formation of transvacuolar strands and bulbs is functionally related. We propose that the bulbs may function transiently to accommodate membranes and proteins when transvacuolar strands fail to elongate. We show that RBB1 corresponds to a very large protein of unknown function that is specific to plants, is present in the cytosol, and may associate with cellular membranes. RBB1 is involved in the regulation of vacuole morphology and may be involved in the establishment or stability of trans-vacuolar strands and bulbs.",

        "Abstract": "The spaceflight environment of the International Space Station poses a multitude of stresses on plant growth including reduced gravity. Plants exposed to microgravity and other conditions on the ISS display root skewing, changes in gene expression and protein abundance that may result in changes in cell wall composition, antioxidant accumulation and modification of growth anisotropy. Systematic studies that address the effects of microgravity on cellular organelles are lacking but altered numbers and sizes of vacuoles have been detected in previous flights. The prominent size of plant vacuoles makes them ideal models to study organelle dynamics in space. Here, we used Arabidopsis zigzag-1 (zig-1) as a sensitized genotype to study the effect of microgravity on plant vacuole fusion. Wortmannin was used to induce vacuole fusion in seedlings and a formaldehyde-based fixation protocol was developed to visualize plant vacuole morphology after sample return, using confocal microscopy. Our results indicate that microgravity enhances the zig-1 phenotype by reducing hypocotyl growth and vacuole fusion in some cells. This study demonstrates the feasibility of chemical inhibitor treatments for plant cell biology experiments in space.",

        "Abstract": "Summary Altered gravity load induced by spaceflight (microgravity) and centrifugation (hypergravity) is associated with changes in circadian, metabolic, and reproductive systems. Exposure to 2-g hypergravity (HG) during pregnancy and lactation decreased rate of mammary metabolic activity and increased pup mortality. We hypothesize HG disrupted maternal homeorhetic responses to pregnancy and lactation are due to changes in maternal metabolism, hormone concentrations, and maternal behavior related to gravity induced alterations in circadian clocks. Effect of HG exposure on mammary, liver and adipose tissue metabolism, plasma hormones and maternal behavior were analyzed in rat dams from mid-pregnancy (Gestational day [G]11) through early lactation (Postnatal day [P]3); comparisons were made across five time-points: G20, G21, P0 (labor and delivery), P1 and P3. Blood, mammary, liver, and adipose tissue were collected for analyzing plasma hormones, glucose oxidation to CO2 and incorporation into lipids, or gene expression. Maternal behavioral phenotyping was conducted using time-lapse videographic analyses. Dam and fetal-pup body mass were significantly reduced in HG in all age groups. HG did not affect labor and delivery; however, HG pups experienced a greater rate of mortality. PRL, corticosterone, and insulin levels and receptor genes were altered by HG. Mammary, liver and adipose tissue metabolism and expression of genes that regulate lipid metabolism were altered by HG exposure. Exposure to HG significantly changed expression of core clock genes in mammary and liver and circadian rhythms of maternal behavior. Gravity load alterations in dam's circadian system may have impacted homeorhetic adaptations needed for a successful lactation.",
        "Conclusion": "Endogenous clocks enable organisms to anticipate periodic changes in the environment and to adapt their physiology accordingly. The transition from pregnancy to lactation represents a major physiological change requiring coordinated adjustments in physiology and metabolism to support milk production. Previous studies from our lab revealed that changes in molecular clocks are coordinated among multiple tissues during the transition from pregnancy to lactation, and suggest that the circadian system may be important in coordinating the metabolic and hormonal changes needed to initiate and sustain lactation. Homeorhetic adaptations to lactation can be affected by physiological and environmental factors. Photoperiod is an example of an environmental factor that affects energy balance, reproduction and lactation (Dahl et al., 2000; Lincoln et al., 2006; Duncan, 2007; Dardente et al., 2010; Silveyra et al., 2010). Photoperiodic information is received and integrated across the circadian system, which effectively coordinates the animal's physiology and metabolome to photoperiod length, including seasonal changes in milk quality and quantity. Similarly, we propose that hypergravity induced alterations in homeorhetic adaptations to lactation including changes in dam metabolic capacity and behavior are due to the impact of increased gravity load on circadian clocks. Changes in circadian clocks affect output of multiple organs resulting in reduced quality and quantity of milk and therefore decreased pup survival in the hypergravity environment.",

Here, we measured methylation of DNA associated with the Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) gene, a gene important in development and plasticity, and telomere length in the brains of adult rat male and female offspring whose mothers were exposed to unpredictable and variable stressors throughout gestation. Males exposed to prenatal stress had greater methylation (Bdnf IV) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) compared to non-stressed male controls and stressed females. Further, prenatally-stressed animals had shorter telomeres than controls in the mPFC. Together findings indicate a long-term impact of prenatal stress on brain DNA methylation and telomere biology with relevance for behavioral and health outcomes, and contribute to a growing literature linking stress to intergenerational molecular changes.",

Using mass spectrometry, 19 microsomal proteins that showed an altered expression level within 5 min after heat treatment were identified. Among these proteins, annexin 1 (AtANN1) was one of those up-regulated rapidly after heat-shock treatment. Functional studies show loss-of-function mutants for AtANN1 and its close homolog AtANN2 were more sensitive to heat-shock treatment, whereas plants overexpressing AtANN1 showed more resistance to this treatment. Correspondingly, the heat-induced expression of heat-shock proteins and heat-shock factors is inhibited in ann1/ann2 double mutant, and the heat-activated increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) is greatly impaired in the ann1 mutant and almost undetectable in ann1/ann2 double mutant. Taken together these results suggest that AtANN1 is important in regulating the heat-induced increase in [Ca2+]cyt and in the response of Arabidopsis seedlings to heat stress.",

In this study, we found that the addition of the same or related apyrase inhibitors could potentiate the ability of different fungicides to inhibit the growth of five different pathogenic fungi in plate growth assays. The growth of all five fungi was partially inhibited by three commonly used fungicides: copper octanoate, myclobutanil and propiconazole. However, when these fungicides were individually tested in combination with any one of four different apyrase inhibitors (AI.1, AI.10, AI.13 or AI.15), their potency to inhibit the growth of five fungal pathogens was increased significantly relative to their application alone. The apyrase inhibitors were most effective in potentiating the ability of copper octanoate to inhibit fungal growth, and least effective in combination with propiconazole. Among the five pathogens assayed, that most sensitive to the fungicide\u2010potentiating effects of the inhibitors was Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Overall, among the 60 treatment combinations tested (five pathogens, four apyrase inhibitors, three fungicides), the addition of apyrase inhibitors increased significantly the sensitivity of fungi to the fungicide treatments in 53 of the combinations. Consistent with their predicted mode of action, inhibitors AI.1, AI.10 and AI.13 each increased the level of propiconazole retained in one of the fungi, suggesting that they could partially block the ability of efflux transporters to remove propiconazole from these fungi.",

        "Abstract": "Microgravity (modeled by head-tilt bedrest and hind-limb unloading), experienced during prolonged spaceflight, results in neurological consequences, central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, and potentially impairment during the performance of critical tasks. Similar pathologies are observed in bedrest, sedentary lifestyle, and muscle disuse on Earth. In our previous study, we saw that head-tilt bedrest together with social isolation upregulated the milieu of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus and plasma. These changes were mitigated in a MCAT mouse model overexpressing human catalase in the mitochondria, pointing out the importance of ROS signaling in this stress response. Here, we used a head-tilt model in socially housed mice to tease out the effects of head-tilt bedrest without isolation. In order to find the underlying molecular mechanisms that provoked the cytokine response, we measured CD68, an indicator of microglial activation in the hippocampus, as well as changes in normal in-cage behavior. We hypothesized that hindlimb unloading (HU) will elicit microglial hippocampal activations, which will be mitigated in the MCAT ROS-quenching mice model. Indeed, we saw an elevation of the activated microglia CD68 marker following HU in the hippocampus, and this pathology was mitigated in MCAT mice. Additionally, we identified cytokines in the hippocampus, which had significant positive correlations with CD68 and negative correlations with exploratory behaviors, indicating a link between neuroinflammation and behavioral consequences. Unveiling a correlation between molecular and behavioral changes could reveal a biomarker indicative of these responses and could also result in a potential target for the treatment and prevention of cognitive changes following long space missions and/or muscle disuse on Earth.",

        "Abstract": "In addition to muscle weakness, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is associated with an increased incidence of skeletal fractures. The SOD1G93A mouse model recapitulates many features of human ALS. These mice also exhibit decreased bone mass. However, the functional, or biomechanical, behavior of the skeleton in SOD1G93A mice has not been investigated. To do so, we examined skeletal phenotypes in end-stage (16-week-old) SOD1G93A female mice and healthy littermate female controls (N=9\u201310/group). Outcomes included trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture by microcomputed tomography; stiffness and strength via three-point bending; resistance to crack growth by fracture toughness testing; and cortical bone matrix properties via cyclic reference point indentation. SOD1G93A mice had similar bone size, but significantly lower trabecular bone mass (\u221254%), thinner trabeculae (\u221241%) and decreased cortical bone thickness (\u221217%) and cortical area (\u221218%) compared to control mice (all p<0.01). In line with these bone mass and microstructure deficits, SOD1G93A mice had significantly lower femoral bending stiffness (\u221227%) and failure moment (\u221241%), along with decreased fracture toughness (\u221218%) (all p<0.001). This is the first study to demonstrate functional deficits in the skeleton of end-stage ALS mice, and imply multiple mechanisms for increased skeletal fragility and fracture risk in patients in ALS. Importantly, our results provide strong rationale for interventions to reduce fracture risk in ALS patients with advanced disease.",

Using a quadrupedal partial weight-bearing (PWB) model in rats that we designed, we investigated the longitudinal time course of muscle function at three different PWB levels. We demonstrated that both muscle mass and muscle function are significantly impaired in reduced weight-bearing environments as early as after 7 days of suspension. Moreover, we showed that muscular alterations are correlated to the PWB level and do not reach a plateau during a 1-month exposure to reduced weight-bearing, emphasizing the need for mitigating countermeasures for safe and successful extraterrestrial exploration.",

BFRT facilitates gains in muscular strength and hypertrophy at lower loads, allowing for accelerated recovery and less disuse atrophy. BFRT must be applied appropriately and with caution, particularly in individuals with cardiovascular concerns. There are applications for BFRT across a wide spectrum of human performance training and in rehabilitation of both lower and upper extremity conditions, providing a high-quality adjunct to improve muscle strength, power, and endurance. Level of EvidenceLevel V, expert opinion.",
        "Conclusion": "BFRT has applications across the continuum of human performance, from immobilization, early rehabilitation with low loads, low-intensity aerobic exercises, as part of a comprehensive strength and conditioning plan, and in recovery. The use of conventional strength training is strongly supported along with the inclusion of BFRT as an adjunct in the otherwise healthy population to optimize mechanical tension, muscle damage, and metabolic stress to drive muscle growth. It is our role as performance coaches and rehabilitation providers to restore, refine, and prepare the relevant structural and functional qualities of the individual for the task in which they will be participating. Muscular hypertrophy is a foundational performance precursor to be able to express and withstand the biomotor, sensorimotor, and bioenergetic demands of sport. BFRT is a progressive training stimulus that can be incorporated across a variety of populations, in number of applications, to produce a more resilient individual.",

        "Abstract": "Reduced skeletal loading leads to marked bone loss. Animal models of hindlimb suspension are widely used to assess alterations in skeleton during the course of complete unloading. More recently, the effects of partial unloading on the musculoskeletal system have been interrogated in mice and rats, revealing dose-dependent effects of partial weight bearing (PWB) on the skeleton and skeletal muscle. Here, we extended these studies to determine the structural and functional skeletal alterations in 14-week-old male Wister rats exposed to 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 1, 2, or 4 weeks (n = 11\u201312/group). Using in vivo pQCT, we found that trabecular bone density at the proximal tibia declined in proportion to the degree of unloading and continued progressively with time, without evidence of a plateau by 4 weeks. Ex vivo measurements of trabecular microarchitecture in the distal femur by microcomputed tomography revealed deficits in bone volume fraction, 2 and 4 weeks after unloading. Histologic analyses of trabecular bone in the distal femur revealed the decreased osteoblast number and mineralizing surface in unloaded rats. Three-point bending of the femoral diaphysis indicated modest or no reductions in femoral stiffness and estimated modulus due to PWB. Our results suggest that this rat model of PWB leads to trabecular bone deterioration that is progressive and generally proportional to the degree of PWB, with minimal effects on cortical bone.",

        "Abstract": "For decades, scientists have relied on animals to understand the risks and consequences of space travel. Animals remain key to study the physiological alterations during spaceflight and provide crucial information about microgravity-induced changes. While spaceflights may appear common, they remain costly and, coupled with limited cargo areas, do not allow for large sample sizes onboard. In 1979, a model of hindlimb unloading (HU) was successfully created to mimic microgravity and has been used extensively since its creation. Four decades later, the first model of mouse partial weight-bearing (PWB) was developed, aiming at mimicking partial gravity environments. Return to the Lunar surface for astronauts is now imminent and prompted the need for an animal model closer to human physiology; hence in 2018, our laboratory created a new model of PWB for adult rats. In this review, we will focus on the rat model of PWB, from its conception to the current state of knowledge. Additionally, we will address how this new model, used in conjunction with HU, will help implement new paradigms allowing scientists to anticipate the physiological alterations and needs of astronauts. Finally, we will discuss the outstanding questions and future perspectives in space research and propose potential solutions using the rat PWB model.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract Ground\u2010based animal models have been used extensively to understand the effects of microgravity on various physiological systems. Among them, hindlimb suspension (HLS), developed in 1979 in rats, remains the gold\u2010standard and allows researchers to study the consequences of total unloading of the hind limbs while inducing a cephalic fluid shift. While this model has already brought valuable insights to space biology, few studies have directly compared functional decrements in the muscles of males and females during HLS. We exposed 28 adult Wistar rats (14 males and 14 females) to 14 days of HLS or normal loading (NL) to better assess how sex impacts disuse\u2010induced muscle deconditioning. Females better maintained muscle function during HLS than males, as shown by a more moderate reduction in grip strength at 7 days (males: \u221237.5 \u00b1 3.1%, females: \u221222.4 \u00b1 6.5%, compared to baseline), that remains stable during the second week of unloading (males: \u221253.3 \u00b1 5.7%, females: \u221222.4 \u00b1 5.5%, compared to day 0) while the males exhibit a steady decrease over time (effect of sex \u00d7 loading p = 0.0002, effect of sex \u00d7 time \u00d7 loading p = 0.0099). This was further supported by analyzing the force production in response to a tetanic stimulus. Further functional analyses using force production were also shown to correspond to sex differences in relative loss of muscle mass and CSA. Moreover, our functional data were supported by histomorphometric analyzes, and we highlighted differences in relative muscle loss and CSA. Specifically, female rats seem to experience a lesser muscle deconditioning during disuse than males thus emphasizing the need for more studies that will assess male and female animals concomitantly to develop tailored, effective countermeasures for all astronauts.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundLiquid cultures have been commonly used in space, toxicology, and pharmacology studies of Caenorhabditis elegans. However, the knowledge about transcriptomic alterations caused by liquid cultivation remains limited. Moreover, the impact of different genotypes in rapid adaptive responses to environmental changes (e.g., liquid cultivation) is often overlooked. Here, we report the transcriptomic and phenotypic responses of laboratory N2 and the wild-isolate AB1 strains after culturing P0 worms on agar plates, F1 in liquid cultures, and F2 back on agar plates. ResultsSignificant variations were found in the gene expressions between the N2 and AB1 strains in response to liquid cultivation. The results demonstrated that 8\u201334% of the environmental change-induced transcriptional responses are transmitted to the subsequent generation. By categorizing the gene expressions for genotype, environment, and genotype-environment interactions, we identified that the genotype has a substantial impact on the adaptive responses. Functional analysis of the transcriptome showed correlation with phenotypical changes. For example, the N2 strain exhibited alterations in both phenotype and gene expressions for germline and cuticle in axenic liquid cultivation. We found transcript evidence to approximately 21% of the computationally predicted genes in C. elegans by exposing the worms to environmental changes. ConclusionsThe presented study reveals substantial differences between N2 and AB1 strains for transcriptomic and phenotypical responses to rapid environmental changes. Our data can provide standard controls for future studies for the liquid cultivation of C. elegans and enable the discovery of condition-specific genes. Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12864-018-4948-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",
        "Conclusion": "Culturing the worms in axenic medium seems to affect the worms more than only changing their physical environment to liquid in the S-Medium. Our results highlight that caution must be used while studying model organisms as the constant laboratory environments can cause substantial differences in the transcriptomic and phenotypic responses to abrupt environmental changes. We believe our data can provide standard controls for future studies that utilize liquid cultivation of C. elegans for experimentations and is a rich resource for the discovery of genes showing environment-specific expression.",

Here, we analyze the transcriptomic response of Caenorhabditis elegans to simulated microgravity and observe the maintained transcriptomic response after returning to ground conditions for four, eight, and twelve days. We show that 75% of the simulated microgravity-induced changes on gene expression persist after returning to ground conditions for four days while most of these changes are reverted after twelve days. Our results from integrative RNA-seq and mass spectrometry analyses suggest that simulated microgravity affects longevity-regulating insulin/IGF-1 and sphingolipid signaling pathways. Finally, we identified 118 genes that are commonly differentially expressed in simulated microgravity- and space-exposed worms. Overall, this work provides insight into the effect of microgravity on biological systems during and after exposure.",

        "Abstract": "Studying microbes at the single-cell level in space can accelerate human space exploration both via the development of novel biotechnologies and via the understanding of cellular responses to space stressors and countermeasures. High-throughput technologies for screening natural and engineered cell populations can reveal cellular heterogeneity and identify high-performance cells. Here, we present a method to desiccate and preserve microbes in nanoliter-scale compartments, termed PicoShells, which are microparticles with a hollow inner cavity. In PicoShells, single cells are confined in an inner aqueous core by a porous hydrogel shell, allowing the diffusion of nutrients, wastes, and assay reagents for uninhibited cell growth and flexible assay protocols. Desiccated PicoShells offer analysis capabilities for single-cell derived colonies with a simple, low resource workflow, requiring only the addition of water to rehydrate hundreds of thousands of PicoShells and the single microbes encapsulated inside. Our desiccation method results in the recovery of desiccated microparticle morphology and porosity after a multi-week storage period and rehydration, with particle diameter and porosity metrics changing by less than 18% and 7%, respectively, compared to fresh microparticles. We also recorded the high viability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast desiccated and rehydrated inside PicoShells, with only a 14% decrease in viability compared to non-desiccated yeast over 8.5 weeks, although we observed an 85% decrease in initial growth potential over the same duration. We show a proof-of-concept for a growth rate-based analysis of single-cell derived colonies in rehydrated PicoShells, where we identified 11% of the population that grows at an accelerated rate. Desiccated PicoShells thus provide a robust method for cell preservation before and during launch, promising a simple single-cell analysis method for studying heterogeneity in microbial populations in space.",

        "Abstract": "Summary The application of omics to study Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) in the context of spaceflight is increasing, illuminating the wide-ranging biological impacts of spaceflight on physiology. In this review, we highlight the application of omics, including transcriptomics, genomics, proteomics, multi-omics, and integrated omics in the study of spaceflown C. elegans, and discuss the impact, use, and future direction of this branch of research. We highlight the variety of molecular alterations that occur in response to spaceflight, most notably changes in metabolic and neuromuscular gene regulation. These transcriptional features are reproducible and evident across many spaceflown species (e.g., mice and astronauts), supporting the use of C. elegans as a model organism to study spaceflight physiology with translational capital. Integrating tissue-specific, spatial, and multi-omics approaches, which quantitatively link molecular responses to phenotypic adaptations, will facilitate the identification of candidate regulatory molecules for therapeutic intervention and thus represents the next frontiers in C. elegans space omics research.",
        "Conclusion": "C. elegans represents a cheap and feasible organism to study the mechanisms regulating phenotypic adaptations in response to microgravity. We highlight that the application of omics analysis to spaceflight research has identified many ways that C. elegans respond to microgravity, at the level of the transcriptome, proteome, and epigenome. Notably, microgravity elicits transcriptional responses with microgravity robustly regulating genes related to muscle locomotion and metabolism (Figure 1). Similarly, proteomic changes in microgravity represent robust declines in cytoskeletal and metabolic proteins, which may underpin the pathophysiological phenotype associated with microgravity, particularly muscle decline. Importantly, these major transcriptional signatures are reproducible despite substantial differences in culturing conditions. Future work should consider using emerging omics approaches, such as multi-omics and spatial transcriptomics, to unravel tissue-specific spatiotemporal responses to microgravity in C. elegans. Where possible, such experiments should adopt, or at least consider, consortium-devised omics-related working pipelines in order to standardize experimental design, such as those developed by the International Standards for Space Omics Processing. In turn, this will facilitate future comparative omics investigations, thus extracting as much insight as possible from rare space omics experiments. This will lead to the identification of the fundamental mechanisms regulating (mal)adaptations to microgravity, benefiting health while in space and on Earth (e.g., aging, diabetes).",

        "Abstract": "Bone loss caused by ionizing radiation is a potential health concern for radiotherapy patients, radiation workers and astronauts. In animal studies, exposure to ionizing radiation increases oxidative damage in skeletal tissues, and results in an imbalance in bone remodeling initiated by increased bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Therefore, we evaluated various candidate interventions with antioxidant or anti-inflammatory activities (antioxidant cocktail, dihydrolipoic acid, ibuprofen, dried plum) both for their ability to blunt the expression of resorption-related genes in marrow cells after irradiation with either gamma rays (photons, 2 Gy) or simulated space radiation (protons and heavy ions, 1 Gy) and to prevent bone loss. Dried plum was most effective in reducing the expression of genes related to bone resorption (Nfe2l2, Rankl, Mcp1, Opg, TNF-\u03b1) and also preventing later cancellous bone decrements caused by irradiation with either photons or heavy ions. Thus, dietary supplementation with DP may prevent the skeletal effects of radiation exposures either in space or on Earth.",

        "Abstract": "Spaceflight is a unique environment that includes at least two factors which can negatively impact skeletal health: microgravity and ionizing radiation. We have previously shown that a diet supplemented with dried plum powder (DP) prevented radiation-induced bone loss in mice. In this study, we investigated the capacity of the DP diet to prevent bone loss in mice following exposure to simulated spaceflight, combining microgravity (by hindlimb unloading) and radiation exposure. The DP diet was effective at preventing most decrements in bone micro-architectural and mechanical properties due to hindlimb unloading alone and simulated spaceflight. Furthermore, we show that the DP diet can protect osteoprogenitors from impairments resulting from simulated microgravity. Based on our findings, a dietary supplementation with DP could be an effective countermeasure against the skeletal deficits observed in astronauts during spaceflight.",

        "Abstract": "Microgravity exposure induces a cephalad fluid shift and an overall reduction in physical activity levels which can lead to cardiovascular deconditioning in the absence of countermeasures. Future spaceflight missions will expose crew to extended periods of microgravity among other stressors, the effects of which on cardiovascular health are not fully known. In this study, we determined cardiac responses to extended microgravity exposure using the rat hindlimb unloading (HU) model. We hypothesized that exposure to prolonged simulated microgravity and subsequent recovery would lead to increased oxidative damage and altered expression of genes involved in the oxidative response. To test this hypothesis, we examined hearts of male (three and nine months of age) and female (3 months of age) Long\u2013Evans rats that underwent HU for various durations up to 90 days and reambulated up to 90 days post-HU. Results indicate sex-dependent changes in oxidative damage marker 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and antioxidant gene expression in left ventricular tissue. Three-month-old females displayed elevated 8-OHdG levels after 14 days of HU while age-matched males did not. In nine-month-old males, there were no differences in 8-OHdG levels between HU and normally loaded control males at any of the timepoints tested following HU. RNAseq analysis of left ventricular tissue from nine-month-old males after 14 days of HU revealed upregulation of pathways involved in pro-inflammatory signaling, immune cell activation and differential expression of genes associated with cardiovascular disease progression. Taken together, these findings provide a rationale for targeting antioxidant and immune pathways and that sex differences should be taken into account in the development of countermeasures to maintain cardiovascular health in space.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a multifaceted and gradually advancing condition characterized by a complex pathogenesis. The current therapeutic options for CKD remain limited in efficacy. Consequently, the identification and exploration of novel drug targets for CKD are of paramount importance. We identified cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) with potential as drug targets from the eQTLGen Consortium database to serve as the exposure. For the outcome, we utilized a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of chronic kidney disease (CKD) from the FinnGen database, which comprised a case group of 11,265 individuals and a control group of 436,208 individuals. MR analysis was employed to investigate druggable genes closely associated with CKD. Subsequently, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were conducted to elucidate the functional roles of these significant genes. Finally, a colocalization analysis was conducted to determine the likelihood that a cis-eQTL for a druggable gene and CKD share a causal variant. The expression of 12 genes was found to be significantly associated with CKD risk, with a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.05. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that these genes are primarily involved in the regulation of MAP kinase activity, regulation of protein serine/threonine kinase activity, Gap junction, Platelet activation and Oxytocin signaling pathway. The colocalization analysis results suggested that CKD and the TUBB gene may share a causal variant, with a posterior probability (PP.H4) exceeding 80% (TUBB: 97.27%). Compelling statistical evidence indicates that TUBB represents the most promising pharmacological target for the treatment of CKD. This study not only identifies potential therapeutic targets but also offers valuable insights for future drug development in the context of CKD.

        "Abstract": "Platelets (PLTs) are anucleate and considered incapable of nuclear functions. Contrastingly, nuclear proteins were detected in human PLTs. For most of these proteins, it is unclear if nuclear or alternatively assigned functions are performed, a question we wanted to address for nuclear assembly protein 1 like 1 (NAP1L1). Using a wide array of molecular methods, including RNAseq, co-IP, overexpression and functional assays, we explored expression pattern and functionality of NAP1L1 in PLTs, and CD34+-derived megakaryocytes (MKs). NAP1L1 is expressed in PLTs and MKs. Co-IP experiments revealed that dihydrolipolylysine-residue acetyltransferase (DLAT encoded protein PDC-E2, ODP2) dynamically interacts with NAP1L1. PDC-E2 is part of the mitochondrial pyruvate-dehydrogenase (PDH) multi-enzyme complex, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular respiration, and promoting ATP-synthesis via the respiratory chain. Since altered mitochondrial function is a hallmark of infectious syndromes, we analyzed PDH activity in PLTs from septic patients demonstrating increased activity, paralleling NAP1L1 expression levels. MKs PDH activity decreased following an LPS-challenge. Furthermore, overexpression of NAP1L1 significantly altered the ability of MKs to form proplatelet extensions, diminishing thrombopoiesis. These results indicate that NAP1L1 performs in other than nucleosome-assembly functions in PTLs and MKs, binding a key mitochondrial protein as a potential chaperone, and gatekeeper, influencing PDH activity and thrombopoiesis.",

Success was evaluated based on comparison of AEM housed animals to that of vivarium housed and to normal biological ranges through various measures of animal health and well-being, including animal health evaluations, animal growth and body masses, organ masses, rodent food bar consumption, water consumption, and analysis of blood contents. The results of this study confirmed that the AEMs could support 12 adult female C57BL/6 mice for up to 35 days with self-contained RFB and water, and the AEMs could also support 5 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats for 35 days with external replenishment of diet and water. This study has demonstrated the capability and flexibility of the AEM to operate for up to 35 days with minor hardware modification. Therefore, with modifications, it is possible to utilize this hardware on the International Space Station or other operational platforms to extend the space life science research use of mice and rats.",

While several biofilm forming species, including Penicillium rubens, have been identified in spacecraft, the effect of microgravity on fungal biofilm formation is unknown. This study sent seven material surfaces (Stainless Steel 316, Aluminum Alloy, Titanium Alloy, Carbon Fiber, Quartz, Silicone, and Nanograss) inoculated with spores of P. rubens to the International Space Station and allowed biofilms to form for 10, 15, and 20 days to understand the effects of microgravity on biofilm morphology and growth. In general, microgravity did not induce changes in the shape of biofilms, nor did it affect growth in terms of biomass, thickness, and surface area coverage. However, microgravity increased or decreased biofilm formation in some cases, and this was incubation-time- and material-dependent. Nanograss was the material with significantly less biofilm formation, both in microgravity and on Earth, and it could potentially be interfering with hyphal adhesion and/or spore germination. Additionally, a decrease in biofilm formation at 20 days, potentially due to nutrient depletion, was seen in some space and Earth samples and was material-dependent.",

One such concern is muscle atrophy, which is partly attributed to the dysregulation of calcium levels due to abnormalities in SERCA pump functioning. To identify potential biomarkers for this condition, multi-omics data and physiological data available on the NASA Open Science Data Repository (osdr.nasa.gov) were used, and machine learning methods were employed. Specifically, we used multi-omics (transcriptomic, proteomic, and DNA methylation) data and calcium reuptake data collected from C57BL/6 J mouse soleus and tibialis anterior tissues during several 30+ day-long missions on the international space station. The QLattice symbolic regression algorithm was introduced to generate highly explainable models that predict either experimental conditions or calcium reuptake levels based on multi-omics features. The list of candidate models established by QLattice was used to identify key features contributing to the predictive capability of these models, with Acyp1 and Rps7 proteins found to be the most predictive biomarkers related to the resilience of the tibialis anterior muscle in space. These findings could serve as targets for future interventions aiming to reduce the extent of muscle atrophy during space travel.",

Bacteriophages are prolific mediators of bacterial adaptation on Earth. Here we survey 245 genomes sequenced from bacterial strains isolated on the International Space Station for dormant (lysogenic) bacteriophages. Our analysis indicates phage-associated genes are significantly different between spaceflight strains and their terrestrial counterparts. In addition, we identify 283 complete prophages, those that could initiate bacterial lysis and infect additional hosts, of which 21% are novel. These prophage regions encode functions that correlate with increased persistence in extreme environments, such as spaceflight, to include antimicrobial resistance and virulence, DNA damage repair, and dormancy. Our results correlate microbial adaptation in spaceflight to bacteriophage-encoded functions that may impact human health in spaceflight.",

Macrophages are important immune cells that bridge the innate and adaptive immune systems and participate in immunoregulatory processes of homeostasis. Furthermore, macrophages are critically involved in initiating immunity, defending against injury and infection, and are also involved in immune resolution and wound healing. Heterogeneous populations of macrophage-type cells reside in many tissues and cause a variety of tissue-specific effects through direct or indirect interactions with other physiological systems, including the nervous and endocrine systems. It is vital to understand how macrophages respond to the unique environment of space to safeguard crew members with appropriate countermeasures for future missions in low Earth orbit and beyond.

        "Abstract": "Whether terrestrial life can withstand the martian environment is of paramount interest for planetary protection measures and space exploration. To understand microbial survival potential in Mars-like conditions, several fungal and bacterial samples were launched in September 2019 on a large NASA scientific balloon flight to the middle stratosphere (\u223c38 km altitude) where radiation levels resembled values at the equatorial Mars surface. Fungal spores of Aspergillus niger and bacterial cells of Salinisphaera shabanensis, Staphylococcus capitis subsp. capitis, and Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9 were launched inside the MARSBOx (Microbes in Atmosphere for Radiation, Survival, and Biological Outcomes Experiment) payload filled with an artificial martian atmosphere and pressure throughout the mission profile. The dried microorganisms were either exposed to full UV-VIS radiation (UV dose = 1148 kJ m\u22122) or were shielded from radiation. After the 5-h stratospheric exposure, samples were assayed for survival and metabolic changes. Spores from the fungus A. niger and cells from the Gram-(\u2013) bacterium S. shabanensis were the most resistant with a 2- and 4-log reduction, respectively. Exposed Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9 was completely inactivated (both with and without UV exposure) and S. capitis subsp. capitis only survived the UV shielded experimental condition (3-log reduction). Our results underscore a wide variation in survival phenotypes of spacecraft associated microorganisms and support the hypothesis that pigmented fungi may be resistant to the martian surface if inadvertently delivered by spacecraft missions.",
        "Conclusion": "To date, a variety of terrestrial analogs and simulation chambers have been used to predict outcomes for microbial exposure to Mars-like conditions. Most often, such investigations use elevated radiation and desiccation paired with low pressure and temperature alongside a Mars gas mixture (Jensen et al., 2008; Schuerger et al., 2008; Motamedi et al., 2015). However, few studies can simultaneously recreate a multi-factor Mars environment. The renewed focus on Mars robotic and human exploration e.g., Mars 2020, Mars Sample Return (NASA, 2020) and ExoMars 2022 (ESA, 2020) amplifies the need for additional Mars analog studies in the coming years. In this study we: \u2022reported the use of a new scientific payload (MARSBOx) for stratospheric balloon missions allowing access to a wide-ranging Mars analog environment with natural ionizing and non-ionizing radiation;\u2022demonstrated a successful experimental set-up, of the Trex-Box and MARSBOx combined, where four different microorganisms could be tested, in dried conditions, throughout a 5-month period, without cross-contaminations.\u2022showed that the extremophilic bacterium S. shabanensis and the human skin-associated bacterium S. capitis subsp. capitis survived the UV-shielded Mars-like environment during the balloon flight, suggesting that bioburden embedded deep inside of spacecraft sent to Mars might remain viable for longer periods of time;\u2022revealed that highly pigmented spores from the fungus A. niger would survive, in a Mars-like middle stratosphere environment for > 5 h of UV exposure, even as a spore monolayer (106 spores mL\u22121), i.e., with no self-shielding. Taken together, we conclude pigmented fungal spores might be considered some of the most likely forward contaminants to survive if inadvertently delivered to Mars. Our results underscore the importance of including fungal spores in Mars forward contamination studies and relevant planetary protection policies, which currently restrict surface bioburden of \u22643 \u00d7 105 bacterial endospores for robotic lander systems that are not carrying instruments to investigate extant martian life (category IVa) (COSPAR, 2020). Moreover, fungal spore sensitivity to extreme heat or to high doses of combined sources of space radiation, as well as to other factors that affect survivability (e.g., regolith reactive compounds or regolith shielding), should be further evaluated to better assess the forward contamination potential in Mars analog environments.",

        "Abstract": "Renewable fuels hold great promise for the future yet their susceptibility to biodegradation and subsequent corrosion represents a challenge that needs to be directly assessed. Biodiesel is a renewable fuel that is widely used as a substitute or extender for petroleum diesel and is composed of a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters derived from plant or animal fats. Biodiesel can be blended up to 20% v/v with ultra-low sulfur diesel (i.e., B20) and used interchangeably with diesel engines and infrastructure. The addition of biodiesel, however, has been linked to increased susceptibility to biodegradation. Microorganisms proliferating via degradation of biodiesel blends have been linked to microbiologically influenced corrosion in the laboratory, but not measured directly in storage tanks (i.e., in situ). To measure in situ microbial proliferation, fuel degradation and microbially influenced corrosion, we conducted a yearlong study of B20 storage tanks in operation at two locations, identified the microorganisms associated with fuel fouling, and measured in situ corrosion. The bacterial populations were more diverse than the fungal populations, and largely unique to each location. The bacterial populations included members of the Acetobacteraceae, Clostridiaceae, and Proteobacteria. The abundant Eukaryotes at both locations consisted of the same taxa, including a filamentous fungus within the family Trichocomaceae, not yet widely recognized as a contaminant of petroleum fuels, and the Saccharomycetaceae family of yeasts. Increases in the absolute and relative abundances of the Trichocomaceae were correlated with significant, visible fouling and pitting corrosion. This study identified the relationship between fouling of B20 with increased rates of corrosion and the microorganisms responsible, largely at the bottom of the sampled storage tanks. To our knowledge this is the first in situ study of this scale incorporating community and corrosion measurements in an active biodiesel storage environment.",
        "Conclusion": "The comprehensive, in situ investigation presented here compliments several other laboratory-based studies (Leung et al., 2006; Bucker et al., 2011; Ching et al., 2016). Together, they illustrate the susceptibility of fuels containing biodiesel to microbial proliferation (fouling), fuel biodegradation, and MIC of associated infrastructure. Here though, we were able to directly link the presence and prevalence of biofilms to pitting corrosion in actively operating B20 storage tanks. We found that a mixed microbial community of filamentous fungi and acid-producing bacteria were able to proliferate in B20 biodiesel storage tanks, cause fouling, degrade fuel by metabolizing the FAME, produce organic acids, and accelerate steel corrosion under biofilms attached to metal surfaces. The same fungal species was responsible for \u201cblooms\u201d of biomass, providing a target for future mitigation strategies. Additional research is underway to characterize this most abundant fungal member of fuels and biofilms observed at both locations (Stamps et al., 2018). Despite the trade-offs in fuel stability due to susceptibility to microbial attack, biodiesel continues to be the most common and economical solution to reduce the environmental impact of petroleum diesel combustion. As such, the use of biodiesel will likely continue to increase worldwide for the foreseeable future. Operator vigilance in fuel quality and storage conditions is required including early mitigation through water removal, cleaning, and even biocide treatment. Each of these methods would likely be the most effective means of controlling fouling, degradation, and corrosion through the prevention of microbial biofilm establishment. While B20 presents new storage challenges to operators, risk assessments informed by this study will aid each operator in formulating the appropriate response if contamination is detected.",

        "Abstract": "Simple SummaryEarthquakes are invariably preceded by a period when stresses increase deep in the Earth. Animals appear to be able to sense impending seismic events. During build-up of stress, electronic charge carriers are activated deep below, called positive holes. Positive holes have unusual properties: they can travel fast and far into and through the surrounding rocks. As they flow, they generate ultralow frequency electromagnetic waves. When they arrive at the Earth surface, they can ionize the air. When they flow into water, they oxidize it to hydrogen peroxides. All these physical and chemical processes can have noticeable effects on animals. AbstractEarthquakes occur when tectonic stresses build up deep in the Earth before catastrophic rupture. During the build-up of stress, processes that occur in the crustal rocks lead to the activation of highly mobile electronic charge carriers. These charge carriers are able to flow out of the stressed rock volume into surrounding rocks. Such outflow constitutes an electric current, which generates electromagnetic (EM) signals. If the outflow occurs in bursts, it will lead to short EM pulses. If the outflow is continuous, the currents may fluctuate, generating EM emissions over a wide frequency range. Only ultralow and extremely low frequency (ULF/ELF) waves travel through rock and can reach the Earth surface. The outflowing charge carriers are (i) positively charged and (ii) highly oxidizing. When they arrive at the Earth surface from below, they build up microscopic electric fields, strong enough to field-ionize air molecules. As a result, the air above the epicentral region of an impending major earthquake often becomes laden with positive airborne ions. Medical research has long shown that positive airborne ions cause changes in stress hormone levels in animals and humans. In addition to the ULF/ELF emissions, positive airborne ions can cause unusual reactions among animals. When the charge carriers flow into water, they oxidize water to hydrogen peroxide. This, plus oxidation of organic compounds, can cause behavioral changes among aquatic animals.",

        "Abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the coronavirus disease that began in 2019 (COVID-19), has been responsible for 1.4 million deaths worldwide as of 13 November 2020. Because at the time of writing no vaccine is yet available, a rapid diagnostic assay is very urgently needed. Herein, we present the development of anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles for the rapid diagnosis of specific COVID-19 viral antigen or virus via a simple colorimetric change observation within a 5 minute time period. For rapid and highly sensitive identification, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) was employed using 4-aminothiophenol as a reporter molecule, which is attached to the gold nanoparticle via an Au\u2013S bond. In the presence of COVID-19 antigen or virus particles, owing to the antigen\u2013antibody interaction, the gold nanoparticles undergo aggregation, changing color from pink to blue, which allows for the determination of the presence of antigen or virus very rapidly by the naked eye, even at concentrations of 1 nanogram (ng) per mL for COVID-19 antigen and 1000 virus particles per mL for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped baculovirus. Importantly, the aggregated gold nanoparticles form \u201chot spots\u201d to provide very strong SERS signal enhancement from anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles via light\u2013matter interactions. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation data indicate a 4-orders-of-magnitude Raman enhancement in \u201chot spot\u201d positions when gold nanoparticles form aggregates. Using a portable Raman analyzer, our reported data demonstrate that our antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticle-based SERS probe has the capability to detect COVID-19 antigen even at a concentration of 4 picograms (pg) per mL and virus at a concentration of 18 virus particles per mL within a 5 minute time period. Using HEK293T cells, which express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), by which SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells, we show that anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles have the capability to inhibit infection by the virus. Our reported data show that antibody attached gold nanoparticles bind to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, thereby inhibiting the virus from binding to cell receptors, which stops virus infection and spread. It also has the capability to destroy the lipid membrane of the virus.",
        "Conclusion": "We have developed novel anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles for rapid virus diagnosis and inhibition. Our reported data demonstrate that antibody attached GNPs can be used for the naked eye detection of specific COVID-19 viral antigen or of pseudo SARS-CoV-2 via a simple colorimetric change. Our experimental data show that anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticle-based sensing of COVID-19 viral antigen or virus is very fast: they can be detected within a 5 minute time period. Our results show that a naked eye assay allows the presence of antigen or virus to be determined even at a concentration of 1 ng mL\u22121 for COVID-19 antigen and 1000 virus particles per mL for pseudo SARS-CoV-2. We have also demonstrated that, using anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticle-based SERS, COVID-19 viral antigen or virus at very low concentrations can be diagnosed within 5 minutes. Our reported data show that, using a portable Raman analyzer, our antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticle-based SERS probe has the capability to detect COVID-19 antigen, even at a concentration of 4 pg mL\u22121 and virus at a concentration of 18 virus particles per mL. Our reported finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation data indicate a 4-orders-of-magnitude Raman enhancement occurs in \u201chot spot\u201d positions when gold nanoparticles formed aggregates. Using HEK293T cells, which express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), by means of which SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into human cells, we demonstrated that anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles have the capability to control viral infection. Our reported data show that the inhibition efficiency is 100% for anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles. On the other hand, for GNPs alone the inhibition efficiency is only around 1% and for 100 ng mL\u22121 antibody the inhibition efficiency is less than 1%. That our reported data indicate 100% inhibition efficiency in the presence of anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles may be due to the fact that antibody attached gold nanoparticles bind to pseudo SARS-CoV-2, thereby inhibiting the virus from binding to cell receptors. Our data show that antibody attached GNPs block viral replication and virus spread in HEK293T cells. They also destroy the virus lipid membrane.",

        "Abstract": "The emergence of double mutation delta (B.1.617.2) variants has dropped vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although COVID-19 is responsible for more than 5.4 M deaths till now, more than 40% of infected individuals are asymptomatic carriers as the immune system of the human body can control the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we report for the first time that human host defense neutrophil \u03b1-defensin HNP1 and human cathelicidin LL-37 peptide-conjugated graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have the capability to prevent the delta variant virus entry into the host cells via blocking SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) binding with host cells\u2019 angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Experimental data shows that due to the binding between the delta variant spike protein RBD and bioconjugate GQDs, in the presence of the delta variant spike protein, the fluorescence signal from GQDs quenched abruptly. Experimental quenching data shows a nonlinear Stern\u2013Volmer quenching profile, which indicates multiple binding sites. Using the modified Hill equation, we have determined n = 2.6 and the effective binding affinity 9 nM, which is comparable with the ACE2\u2013spike protein binding affinity (8 nM). Using the alpha, beta, and gamma variant spike-RBD, experimental data shows that the binding affinity for the delta B.1.617.2 variant is higher than those for the other variants. Further investigation using the HEK293T-human ACE2 cell line indicates that peptide-conjugated GQDs have the capability for completely inhibiting the entry of delta variant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions into host cells via blocking the ACE2\u2013spike protein binding. Experimental data shows that the inhibition efficiency for LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs are much higher than that of only one type of peptide-attached GQDs.",
        "Conclusion": "4  In conclusion, in the current article, we show that HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated GQDs can be used to prevent the delta variant virus entry into the host cells by blocking spike protein RBD binding with ACE2.

        "Abstract": "PurposeIntranasally administered unfractionated heparin (UFH) and other sulfated polysaccharides are potential prophylactics for COVID-19. The purpose of this research was to measure the safety and pharmacokinetics of clearance of intranasally administered UFH solution from the nasal cavity. MethodsDouble-blinded daily intranasal dosing in C57Bl6 mice with four doses (60 ng to 60 \u03bcg) of UFH was carried out for fourteen consecutive days, with both blood coagulation measurements and subject adverse event monitoring. The pharmacokinetics of fluorescent-labeled UFH clearance from the nasal cavity were measured in mice by in vivo imaging. Intranasal UFH at 2000 U/day solution with nasal spray device was tested for safety in a small number of healthy human subjects. ResultsUFH showed no evidence of toxicity in mice at any dose measured. No significant changes were observed in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), platelet count, or frequency of minor irritant events over vehicle-only control. Human subjects showed no significant changes in aPTT time, international normalized ratio (INR), or platelet count over baseline measurements. No serious adverse events were observed. In vivo imaging in a mouse model showed a single phase clearance of UFH from the nasal cavity. After 12 h, 3.2% of the administered UFH remained in the nasal cavity, decaying to background levels by 48 h. ConclusionsUFH showed no toxic effects for extended daily intranasal dosing in mice as well as humans. The clearance kinetics of intranasal heparin solution from the nasal cavity indicates potentially protective levels for up to 12 h after dosing. Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11095-022-03191-4.",
        "Conclusion": "Our results demonstrated that UFH produces no local nor systemic adverse effects when administered intranasally to either mice or human volunteers. We observed no signs of nasal inflammation, epistaxis, alterations on platelet count that could lead to potential heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and significant changes on the aPTT analysis. Our findings revealed no overt signs of toxicity nor disruption of olfactory functions in mice administered UFH intranasally over two weeks at doses up to 60 \u03bcg/day. From the findings of in vivo imaging, we observed a two-phase clearance of intranasal UFH from the nasal cavity, with protective concentrations still present 12 h post-dosing, in which approximately 2% of the starting dose remained in the cavity until background levels were again reached after 12 additional hours. No significant changes were observed for aPTT, PT/INR, and platelet counts in human volunteers, indicating that intranasal administration of heparin is tolerable at doses up to at least 2000 U/day for at least 14 days. The lack of both local irritation and systemic bioavailability suggest that intranasal heparin may have a high tolerance with a potentially large therapeutic window for preventing viral infections from respiratory viruses that use heparan sulfate as a co-receptor, including SARS-CoV-2.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract The Coronavirus disease pandemic has steered the global therapeutic research efforts toward the discovery of potential anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) molecules. The role of the viral spike glycoprotein (S-protein) has been clearly established in SARS-CoV-2 infection through its capacity to bind to the host cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) and angiotensin-converting enzyme-2. The antiviral strategies targeting these 2 virus receptors are currently under intense investigation. However, the rapid evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 genome has resulted in numerous mutations in the S-protein posing a significant challenge for the design of S-protein-targeted inhibitors. As an example, the 2 key mutations in the S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), L452R, and T478K in the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) confer tighter binding to the host epithelial cells. Marine sulfated glycans (MSGs) demonstrate excellent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 via competitive disruption of the S-protein RBD-HSPG interactions and thus have the potential to be developed into effective prophylactic and therapeutic molecules. In this study, 7 different MSGs were evaluated for their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in a virus entry assay utilizing a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus coated with S-protein of the wild-type (Wuhan-Hu-1) or the Delta (B.1.617.2) strain. Although all tested MSGs showed strong inhibitory activity against both strains, no correlations between MSG structural features and virus inhibition could be drawn. Nevertheless, the current study provides evidence for the maintenance of inhibitory activity of MSGs against evolving SARS-CoV-2 strains.",

        "Abstract": "Many viruses attach to host cells by first interacting with cell surface proteoglycans containing heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan chains and then by engaging with specific receptor, resulting in virus entry. In this project, HS\u2013virus interactions were targeted by a new fucosylated chondroitin sulfate from the sea cucumber Pentacta pygmaea (PpFucCS) in order to block human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) entry into cells. Human foreskin fibroblasts were infected with HCMV in the presence of PpFucCS and its low molecular weight (LMW) fractions and the virus yield at five days post-infection was assessed. The virus attachment and entry into the cells were visualized by labeling the purified virus particles with a self-quenching fluorophore octadecyl rhodamine B (R18). The native PpFucCS exhibited potent inhibitory activity against HCMV specifically blocking virus entry into the cell and the inhibitory activities of the LMW PpFucCS derivatives were proportional to their chain lengths. PpFucCS and the derived oligosaccharides did not exhibit any significant cytotoxicity; moreover, they protected the infected cells from virus-induced lytic cell death. In conclusion, PpFucCS inhibits the entry of HCMV into cells and the high MW of this carbohydrate is a key structural element to achieve the maximal anti-viral effect. This new marine sulfated glycan can be developed into a potential prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral agent against HCMV infection.",

        "Abstract": "Human exploration of the solar system will expose crew members to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), with a potential for adverse health effects. GCR particles (protons and ions) move at nearly the speed of light and easily penetrate space station walls, as well as the human body. Previously, we have shown reactivation of latent herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus, Varicella zoster virus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV), during stays at the International Space Station. Given the prevalence of latent CMV and the known propensity of space radiation to cause alterations in many cellular processes, we undertook this study to understand the role of GCR in reactivating latent CMV. Latently infected Kasumi cells with CMV were irradiated with 137Cs gamma rays, 150 MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, 600 MeV/n iron ions, proton ions, and simulated GCR. The CMV copy number increased significantly in the cells exposed to radiation as compared with the non-irradiated controls. Viral genome sequencing did not reveal significant nucleotide differences among the compared groups. However, transcriptome analysis showed the upregulation of transcription of the UL49 ORF, implicating it in the switch from latent to lytic replication. These findings support our hypothesis that GCR may be a strong contributor to the reactivation of CMV infection seen in ISS crew members.",

Specimens must be harvested with minimal time after landing to minimize postflight readaptation alterations in protein expression/translation, posttranslational modifications, and expression, as well as changes in gene expression and tissue histological degradation after euthanasia. We report the development of a widely applicable strategy for determining the window of optimal species-specific and tissue-specific posteuthanasia harvest that can be utilized to integrate into multi-investigator Biospecimen Sharing Programs. We also determined methods for ISS-compatible long-term tissue storage (10 months at \u221280\u00b0C) that yield recovery of high quality mRNA and protein for western analysis after sample return. Our focus was reproductive tissues. The time following euthanasia where tissues could be collected and histological integrity was maintained varied with tissue and species ranging between 1 and 3 hours. RNA quality was preserved in key reproductive tissues fixed in RNAlater up to 40 min after euthanasia. Postfixation processing was also standardized for safe shipment back to our laboratory. Our strategy can be adapted for other tissues under NASA's Biospecimen Sharing Program or similar multi-investigator tissue sharing opportunities.",

Here, we extend molecular work to energy metabolism and sex hormone signaling in mice and humans. We found spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen signaling in rodents and humans. Murine changes were most prominent in the liver, where we observed inhibition of insulin and estrogen receptor signaling with concomitant hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis. Based on the metabolic demand, metabolic pathways mediated by insulin and estrogen vary among muscles, specifically between the soleus and extensor digitorum longus. In humans, spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen related genes and pathways. Pathway analysis demonstrated spaceflight induced changes in insulin resistance, estrogen signaling, stress response, and viral infection. These data strongly suggest the need for further research on the metabolic and reproductive endocrinologic effects of space travel, if we are to become a successful interplanetary species.",

        "Abstract": "The musculoskeletal system is sensitive to its loading environment; this is of particular concern under conditions such as disuse, paralysis, and extended-duration space flight. Although structural and mechanical changes to tendon and bone following paralysis and disuse are well understood, there is a pressing need to understand how this unloading affects the bone-tendon interface (enthesis); the location most prone to tears and injury. We therefore elucidated these effects of unloading in the entheses of adult mice shoulders that were paralyzed for 21 days by treatment with botulinum toxin A. Unloading significantly increased the extent of mechanical failure and was associated with structural changes across hierarchical scales. At the millimeter scale, unloading caused bone loss. At the micrometer scale, unloading decreased bioapatite crystal size and crystallographic alignment in the enthesis. At the nanometer scale, unloading induced compositional changes that stiffened the bioapatite/collagen composite tissue. Mathematical modeling and mechanical testing indicated that these factors combined to increase local elevations of stress while decreasing the ability of the tissue to absorb energy prior to failure, thereby increasing injury risk. These first observations of the multiscale effects of unloading on the adult enthesis provide new insight into the hierarchical features of structure and composition that endow the enthesis with increased resistance to failure.",

        "Abstract": "Despite a wealth of data on the effects of spaceflight on tendons and bones, little is known about its effects on the interfacial tissue between these two structures, the enthesis. Mice were sent to space on three separate missions: STS-131, STS-135, and Bion-M1 to determine how spaceflight affects the composition, structure, mechanics, and gene expression of the humerus-supraspinatus and calcaneus-Achilles entheses. At the nanoscale, spaceflight resulted in decreased carbonate levels in the bone, likely due to increased remodeling, as suggested by increased expression of genes related to osteoclastogenesis (CatK, Tnfsf11) and mature osteoblasts (Col1, Osc). Tendons showed a shift in collagen fibril size towards smaller diameters that may have resulted from increased expression of genes related to collagen degradation (Mmp3, Mmp13). These nanoscale changes did not result in micro- and milliscale changes to the structure and mechanics of the enthesis. There were no changes in bone volume, trabecular structure, failure load, or stiffness with spaceflight. This lack of tissue-level change may be anatomy based, as extremities may be less sensitive to spaceflight than central locations such as vertebrae, yet results highlight that the tendon enthesis may be robust against negative effects of spaceflight.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundSpace environment imposes a range of challenges to mammalian physiology and the gut microbiota, and interactions between the two are thought to be important in mammalian health in space. While previous findings have demonstrated a change in the gut microbial community structure during spaceflight, specific environmental factors that alter the gut microbiome and the functional relevance of the microbiome changes during spaceflight remain elusive. MethodsWe profiled the microbiome using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in fecal samples collected from mice after a 37-day spaceflight onboard the International Space Station. We developed an analytical tool, named STARMAPs (Similarity Test for Accordant and Reproducible Microbiome Abundance Patterns), to compare microbiome changes reported here to other relevant datasets. We also integrated the gut microbiome data with the publically available transcriptomic data in the liver of the same animals for a systems-level analysis. ResultsWe report an elevated microbiome alpha diversity and an altered microbial community structure that were associated with spaceflight environment. Using STARMAPs, we found the observed microbiome changes shared similarity with data reported in mice flown in a previous space shuttle mission, suggesting reproducibility of the effects of spaceflight on the gut microbiome. However, such changes were not comparable with those induced by space-type radiation in Earth-based studies. We found spaceflight led to significantly altered taxon abundance in one order, one family, five genera, and six species of microbes. This was accompanied by a change in the inferred microbial gene abundance that suggests an altered capacity in energy metabolism. Finally, we identified host genes whose expression in the liver were concordantly altered with the inferred gut microbial gene content, particularly highlighting a relationship between host genes involved in protein metabolism and microbial genes involved in putrescine degradation. ConclusionsThese observations shed light on the specific environmental factors that contributed to a robust effect on the gut microbiome during spaceflight with important implications for mammalian metabolism. Our findings represent a key step toward a better understanding the role of the gut microbiome in mammalian health during spaceflight and provide a basis for future efforts to develop microbiota-based countermeasures that mitigate risks to crew health during long-term human space expeditions. Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s40168-019-0724-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",
        "Conclusion": "Taken together, our observations demonstrate a robust effect of the spaceflight on the gut microbiome, which may be attributed to specific space environmental factors, likely microgravity, and suggest an altered metabolic potential in the gut microbiota that was associated with the expression of metabolic genes in the host liver. We speculate that microgravity leads to an altered metabolic environment for the microbes in the gastrointestinal tract via mechanisms such as lowered fluid shear dynamics, altered digesta movement, as well as other physiological and behavioral responses of the host, and the gut microbiota adapts to such changes by shifting community structure and associated gene content, which may in turn influence host biological functions. As such, a change in the gut microbiota is a key component of mammalian adaptation to the space environment. Further characterizations and mechanistic studies of the complex interactions between the host and the gut microbiome during spaceflight are needed and may enable interventions allowing the microbial communities to adapt to the spaceflight-associated metabolic environment in the gut while avoiding harm or even conferring benefits to mammalian physiology. Such a strategy will mitigate risks to crew health and performance during future long-term spaceflight missions.",

        "Abstract": "A reciprocal association between bone marrow fat and bone mass has been reported in ovariectomized rodents, suggesting that bone marrow adipogenesis has a negative effect on bone growth and turnover balance. Mice with loss of function mutations in kit receptor (kitW/W-v) have no bone marrow adipocytes in tibia or lumbar vertebra. We therefore tested the hypothesis that marrow fat contributes to development of osteopenia by comparing the skeletal response to ovariectomy (ovx) in growing wild type (WT) and bone marrow adipocyte-deficient kitW/W-v mice. Mice were ovx at 4 weeks of age and sacrificed 4 or 10 weeks post-surgery. Body composition was measured at necropsy by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Cortical (tibia) and cancellous (tibia and lumbar vertebra) bone architecture were evaluated by microcomputed tomography. Bone marrow adipocyte size and density, osteoblast- and osteoclast-lined bone perimeters, and bone formation were determined by histomorphometry. Ovx resulted in an increase in total body fat mass at 10 weeks post-ovx in both genotypes, but the response was attenuated in the in kitW/W-v mice. Adipocytes were present in bone marrow of tibia and lumbar vertebra in WT mice and bone marrow adiposity increased following ovx. In contrast, marrow adipocytes were not detected in either intact or ovx kitW/W-v mice. However, ovx in WT and kitW/W-v mice resulted in statistically indistinguishable changes in cortical and cancellous bone mass, cortical and cancellous bone formation rate, and cancellous osteoblast and osteoclast-lined bone perimeters. In conclusion, our findings do not support a causal role for increased bone marrow fat as a mediator of ovx-induced osteopenia in mice.",

        "Abstract": "The present studies investigated the cellular mechanisms for the detrimental effects of high dose whole body \u03b3-irradiation on bone. In addition, radioadaptation and bone marrow transplantation were assessed as interventions to mitigate the skeletal complications of irradiation. Increased trabecular thickness and separation and reduced fractional cancellous bone volume, connectivity density, and trabecular number were detected in proximal tibia and lumbar vertebra 14 days following \u03b3-irradiation with 6 Gy. To establish the cellular mechanism for the architectural changes, vertebrae were analyzed by histomorphometry 1, 3, and 14 days following irradiation. Marrow cell density decreased within 1 day (67% reduction, p<0.0001), reached a minimum value after 3 days (86% reduction, p<0.0001), and partially rebounded by 14 days (30% reduction, p=0.0025) following irradiation. In contrast, osteoblast-lined bone perimeter was increased by 290% (1 day, p=0.04), 1230% (3 days, p<0.0001), and 530% (14 days, p=0.003), respectively. There was a strong association between radiation-induced marrow cell death and activation of bone lining cells to express the osteoblast phenotype (Pearson correlation \u22120.85, p<0.0001). An increase (p=0.004) in osteoclast-lined bone perimeter was also detected with irradiation. A priming dose of \u03b3-radiation (0.5 mGy), previously shown to reduce mortality, had minimal effect on the cellular responses to radiation and did not prevent detrimental changes in bone architecture. Bone marrow transplantation normalized marrow cell density, bone turnover, and most indices of bone architecture following irradiation. In summary, radiation-induced death of marrow cells is associated with 1) a transient increase in bone formation due, at least in part, to activation of bone lining cells, and 2) an increase in bone resorption due to increased osteoclast perimeter. Bone marrow transplantation is effective in mitigating the detrimental effects of acute exposure to high dose whole body \u03b3-radiation on bone turnover.",

        "Abstract": "Leptin-deficient ob/ob mice are morbidly obese and exhibit low total bone mass and mild osteopetrosis. In order to disassociate the skeletal effects of leptin deficiency from those associated with morbid obesity, we evaluated bone mass, architecture, gene expression, and indices of bone turnover in wild type (WT) mice, ob/ob mice fed ad libitum (ob/ob), and ob/ob mice pair fed to WT mice (pair-fed ob/ob). Mice were maintained at 32\u00b0C (thermoneutral) from 6 to 18 weeks of age to minimize differences in resting energy expenditure. ob/ob mice were heavier, had more abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT), and were hyperglycemic compared to WT mice. Femur length, bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density, and midshaft femur cortical thickness were lower in ob/ob mice than in WT mice. Cancellous bone volume fraction was higher but indices of bone formation and resorption were lower in ob/ob compared to WT mice; reduced bone resorption in ob/ob mice resulted in pathological retention of calcified cartilage. Pair-fed ob/ob mice were lighter, had lower WAT, uterine weight, and serum glucose than ob/ob mice. Similarly, femoral length, BMC, and cortical thickness were lower in pair-fed ob/ob mice compared to ob/ob mice, as were indices of cancellous bone formation and resorption. In contrast, bone marrow adiposity, calcified cartilage and cancellous bone volume fraction were higher at one or more cancellous sites in pair-fed ob/ob mice compared to ob/ob mice. These findings demonstrate that the skeletal abnormalities caused by leptin deficiency are markedly attenuated in morbidly obese ob/ob mice.",

        "Abstract": "Excessive weight gain in adults is associated with a variety of negative health outcomes. Unfortunately, dieting, exercise, and pharmacological interventions have had limited long-term success in weight control and can result in detrimental side effects, including accelerating age-related cancellous bone loss. We investigated the efficacy of using hypothalamic leptin gene therapy as an alternative method for reducing weight in skeletally-mature (9-month-old) female rats and determined the impact of leptin-induced weight loss on bone mass, density, and microarchitecture, and serum biomarkers of bone turnover (CTx and osteocalcin). Rats were implanted with cannulae in the 3rd ventricle of the hypothalamus and injected with either recombinant adeno-associated virus encoding the gene for rat leptin (rAAV-Leptin, n=7) or a control vector encoding green fluorescent protein (rAAV-GFP, n=10) and sacrificed 18 weeks later. A baseline control group (n=7) was sacrificed at vector administration. rAAV-Leptin-treated rats lost weight (\u22124\u00b12%) while rAAV-GFP-treated rats gained weight (14\u00b12%) during the study. At study termination, rAAV-Leptin-treated rats weighed 17% less than rAAV-GFP-treated rats and had lower abdominal white adipose tissue weight (\u221280%), serum leptin (\u221277%), and serum IGF1 (\u221234%). Cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis, and in lumbar vertebra tended to be lower (p<0.1) in rAAV-GFP-treated rats (13.5-months-old) compared to baseline control rats (9-months-old). Significant differences in cancellous bone or biomarkers of bone turnover were not detected between rAAV-Leptin and rAAV-GFP rats. In summary, rAAV-Leptin-treated rats maintained a lower body weight compared to baseline and rAAV-GFP-treated rats with minimal effects on bone mass, density, microarchitecture, or biochemical markers of bone turnover.",

        "Abstract": "Low bone mass is often associated with elevated bone marrow adiposity. Since osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from the same mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) progenitor, adipocyte formation may increase at the expense of osteoblast formation. Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone known to regulate energy and bone metabolism. Leptin deficiency and high-fat diet-induced obesity are associated with increased marrow adipose tissue (MAT) and reduced bone formation. Short-duration studies suggest that leptin treatment reduces MAT and increases bone formation in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice fed a regular diet. Here, we determined the long-duration impact of increased hypothalamic leptin on marrow adipocytes and osteoblasts in ob/ob mice following recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene therapy. Eight- to 10-week-old male ob/ob mice were randomized into four groups: (1) untreated, (2) rAAV-Lep, (3) rAAV-green fluorescent protein (rAAV-GFP), or (4) pair-fed to rAAV-Lep. For vector administration, mice were injected intracerebroventricularly with either rAAV-leptin gene therapy (rAAV-Lep) or rAAV-GFP (9 \u00d7 107 particles) and maintained for 30 weeks. In a second study, the impact of increased hypothalamic leptin levels on MAT was determined in mice fed high-fat diets; ob/ob mice were randomized into two groups and treated with either rAAV-Lep or rAAV-GFP. At 7 weeks post-vector administration, half the mice in each group were switched to a high-fat diet for 8 weeks. Wild-type (WT) controls included age-matched mice fed regular or high-fat diet. High-fat diet resulted in a threefold increase in MAT in WT mice, whereas MAT was increased by leptin deficiency up to 50-fold. Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy increased osteoblast perimeter and osteoclast perimeter with minor change in cancellous bone architecture. The gene therapy decreased MAT levels in ob/ob mice fed regular or high-fat diet to values similar to WT mice fed regular diet. These findings suggest that leptin plays an important role in regulating the differentiation of MSCs to adipocytes and osteoblasts, a process that may be dysregulated by high-fat diet. However, the results also illustrate that reducing MAT by increasing leptin levels does not necessarily result in increased bone mass.",

        "Abstract": "PurposeFemale mice are often used as preclinical models for osteoporosis but, in contrast to humans, mice exhibit cancellous bone loss during growth. Mice are routinely housed at room temperature (18\u201323\u00b0C), a strategy that exaggerates physiological differences in thermoregulation between mice (obligatory daily heterotherms) and humans (homeotherms). The purpose of this investigation was to assess whether housing female mice at thermoneutral (temperature range where the basal rate of energy production is at equilibrium with heat loss) alters bone growth, turnover and microarchitecture. MethodsGrowing (4-week-old) female C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ mice were housed at either 22 \u00b0C or 32\u00b0C for up to 18 weeks. ResultsC57BL/6J mice housed at 22\u00b0C experienced a 62% cancellous bone loss from the distal femur metaphysis during the interval from 8\u201318 weeks of age and lesser bone loss from the distal femur epiphysis, whereas cancellous and cortical bone mass in 32\u00b0C-housed mice were unchanged or increased. The impact of thermoneutral housing on cancellous bone was not limited to C57BL/6J mice as C3H/HeJ mice exhibited a similar skeletal response. The beneficial effects of thermoneutral housing on cancellous bone were associated with decreased Ucp1 gene expression in brown adipose tissue, increased bone marrow adiposity, higher rates of bone formation, higher expression levels of osteogenic genes and locally decreased bone resorption. ConclusionsHousing female mice at 22\u00b0C resulted in premature cancellous bone loss. Failure to account for species differences in thermoregulation may seriously confound interpretation of studies utilizing mice as preclinical models for osteoporosis.",

        "Abstract": "There is often a reciprocal relationship between bone marrow adipocytes and osteoblasts, suggesting that marrow adipose tissue (MAT) antagonizes osteoblast differentiation. MAT is increased in rodents during spaceflight but a causal relationship between MAT and bone loss remains unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of a 14-day spaceflight on bone mass, bone resorption, bone formation, and MAT in lumbar vertebrae of ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Twelve-week-old OVX Fischer 344 rats were randomly assigned to a ground control or flight group. Following flight, histological sections of the second lumbar vertebrae (n=11/group) were stained using a technique that allowed simultaneous quantification of cells and preflight fluorochrome label. Compared with ground controls, rats flown in space had 32% lower cancellous bone area and 306% higher MAT. The increased adiposity was due to an increase in adipocyte number (224%) and size (26%). Mineral apposition rate and osteoblast turnover were unchanged during spaceflight. In contrast, resorption of a preflight fluorochrome and osteoclast-lined bone perimeter were increased (16% and 229%, respectively). The present findings indicate that cancellous bone loss in rat lumbar vertebrae during spaceflight is accompanied by increased bone resorption and MAT but no change in bone formation. These findings do not support the hypothesis that increased MAT during spaceflight reduces osteoblast activity or lifespan. However, in the context of ovarian hormone deficiency, bone formation during spaceflight was insufficient to balance increased resorption, indicating defective coupling. The results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that during spaceflight mesenchymal stem cells are diverted to adipocytes at the expense of forming osteoblasts.",

        "Abstract": "The absence of leptin results in contrasting growth pattern of appendicular and axial bone growth in ob/ob mice. Endochondral bone formation is an important procedure of growth plate determining the bone growth, where this procedure is also regulated by estrogen and its receptor (ER) signaling pathway. The present study is undertaken to explore the roles of ERs in regulating the different growth patterns in ob/ob mice. In this study, C57BL/6 female mice were used as wild-type (WT) mice; ob/ob mice and WT mice were age-matched fed, and bone length is analyzed by X-ray plain film at the 12 weeks old. We confirm that ob/ob mice have shorter femoral length and longer spine length than WT mice (p < 0.05). The contrasting expression patterns of chondrocyte proliferation proteins and hypertrophic marker proteins are also observed from the femur and spinal growth plate of ob/ob mice compared with WT mice (p < 0.01). Spearman\u2019s analysis showed that body length (axial and appendicular length) is positively related to the expression level of ER\u03b1 in growth plate. Three-week-old female ob/ob mice are randomized divided into three groups: 1) ob/ob + ctrl, 2) ob/ob + ER\u03b1 antagonist (MPP), and 3) ob/ob + ER\u03b2 antagonist (PHTPP). Age-matched C57BL/6 mice were also divided into three groups, same as the groups of ob/ob mice. MPP and PHTPP were administered by intraperitoneal injection for 6 weeks. However, the results of X-ray and H&E staining demonstrate that leptin deficiency seems to disturb the regulating effects of ER antagonists on longitudinal bone growth. These findings suggested that region-specific expression of ER\u03b1 might be associated with contrasting phenotypes of axial and appendicular bone growth in ob/ob mice. However, ER signaling on longitudinal bone growth was blunted by leptin deficiency in ob/ob mice, and the underlying association between ERs and leptin needs to be explored in future work.",

        "Abstract": "Impaired resorption of cartilage matrix deposited during endochondral ossification is a defining feature of juvenile osteopetrosis. Growing, leptin-deficient ob/ob mice exhibit a mild form of osteopetrosis. However, the extent to which the disease is (1) self-limiting and (2) reversible by leptin treatment is unknown. We addressed the first question by performing histomorphometric analysis of femurs in rapidly growing (2-month-old), slowly growing (4-month-old), and skeletally mature (6-month-old) wild type (WT) and ob/ob male mice. Absent by 6 months of age in WT mice, cartilage matrix persisted to varying extents in distal femur epiphysis, metaphysis and diaphysis in ob/ob mice, suggesting that the osteopetrotic phenotype is not entirely self-limiting. To address the second question, we employed hypothalamic recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene therapy to restore leptin signaling in ob/ob mice. Two-month-old mice were randomized to one of three groups: (1) untreated control, (2) rAAV-Leptin, or (3) control vector rAAV-green fluorescent protein and vectors injected intracerebroventricularly. Seven months later, rAAV-Leptin-treated mice exhibited no cartilage in the metaphysis and greatly reduced cartilage in the epiphysis and diaphysis. At the cellular level, the reduction in cartilage was associated with increased bone turnover. These findings (1) support the concept that leptin is important for normal replacement of cartilage by bone, and (2) demonstrate that osteopetrosis in ob/ob mice is bone compartment specific and reversible by leptin at skeletal sites capable of undergoing robust bone turnover.",

        "Abstract": "Leptin, the protein product of the ob gene, is essential for normal bone growth, maturation, and turnover. Peripheral actions of leptin occur at lower serum levels of the hormone than central actions because entry of leptin into the central nervous system (CNS) is limited due to its saturable transport across the blood brain barrier (BBB). We performed a study in mice to model the impact of leptin production associated with different levels of adiposity on bone formation and compared the response with well-established centrally-mediated actions of the hormone on energy metabolism. Leptin was infused (0, 4, 12, 40, 140, or 400 ng/h) for 12 days into 6-week-old female ob/ob mice (n=8/group) using sc implanted osmotic pumps. Treatment resulted in a dose-associated increase in serum leptin. Bone formation parameters were increased at EC50 infusion rates of 7\u201317 ng/h whereas higher levels (EC50, 40\u201380 ng/h) were required to similarly impact indices of energy metabolism. We then analyzed gene expression in tibia and hypothalamus at dose rates of 0, 12 and 140 ng/h; the latter dose resulted in serum leptin levels similar to WT mice. Infusion with 12 ng/h leptin increased expression of genes associated with Jak/Stat signaling and bone formation in tibia with minimal effect on Jak/Stat signaling and neurotransmitters in hypothalamus. The results suggest that leptin acts peripherally to couple bone acquisition to energy availability and that limited transport across the BBB insures that the growth promoting actions of peripheral leptin are not curtailed by the hormone\u2019s CNS-mediated anorexigenic actions.",

Male MAT- and wild-type (WT) mice were randomly assigned to a baseline, control or HU group (n = 10 mice/group) within each genotype and HU groups unloaded for 2 weeks. Femurs were evaluated using micro-computed tomography, histomorphometry and targeted gene profiling. MAT- mice had a greater reduction in bone volume fraction after HU than did WT mice. HU MAT- mice had elevated cancellous bone formation and resorption compared to other treatment groups as well as a unique profile of differentially expressed genes. Adoptive transfer of WT bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells reconstituted c-kit but not MAT in KitW/W\u2212v mice. The MAT- WT \u2192 KitW/W\u2212v mice lost cancellous bone following 2 weeks of HU.

        "Abstract": "The mannose receptor C-type 1 (Mrc1) is a C-type lectin receptor expressed on the immune cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells (ECs) of several tissues, including the bone marrow (BM). Parallel to systemic metabolic alterations and hematopoietic cell proliferation, high-fat diet (HFD) feeding increases the expression of Mrc1 in sinusoidal ECs, thus calling for the investigation of its role in bone marrow cell reprogramming and the metabolic profile during obesity. Mrc1\u2212/\u2212 mice and wild-type (WT) littermates were fed an HFD (45% Kcal/diet) for 20 weeks. Weight gain was monitored during the diet regimen and glucose and insulin tolerance were assessed. Extensive flow cytometry profiling, histological, and proteomic analyses were performed. After HFD feeding, Mrc1\u2212/\u2212 mice presented impaired medullary hematopoiesis with reduced myeloid progenitors and mature cells in parallel with an increase in BM adipocytes compared to controls. Accordingly, circulating levels of neutrophils and pro-inflammatory monocytes decreased in Mrc1\u2212/\u2212 mice together with reduced infiltration of macrophages in the visceral adipose tissue and the liver compared to controls. Liver histological profiling coupled with untargeted proteomic analysis revealed that Mrc1\u2212/\u2212 mice presented decreased liver steatosis and the downregulation of proteins belonging to pathways involved in liver dysfunction. This profile was reflected by improved glucose and insulin response and reduced weight gain during HFD feeding in Mrc1\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to controls. Our data show that during HFD feeding, mannose receptor deficiency impacts BM and circulating immune cell subsets, which is associated with reduced systemic inflammation and resistance to obesity development.",

        "Abstract": "Total-body irradiation (TBI) followed by transfer of bone marrow cells from donors is routinely performed in immunology research and can be used to manipulate differentiation and/or function of bone cells. However, exposure to high-dose radiation can result in irreversible osteopenia, and transfer of heterogeneous cell populations can complicate interpretation of results. The goal of this research was to establish an approach for reconstituting bone marrow using small numbers of purified donor-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) without negatively affecting bone metabolism. Gamma-irradiated (9 Gy) WBB6F1 mice were engrafted with bone marrow cells (5 \u00d7 106 cells) or purified HSCs (3,000 cells) obtained from GFP transgenic mice. In vivo analysis and in vitro differentiation assays performed two months later established that both methods were effective in reconstituting the hematopoietic compartment with donor-derived cells. We confirmed these findings by engrafting C57Bl/6 (B6) mice with bone marrow cells or purified HSCs from CD45.1 B6 congenic mice. We next performed adoptive transfer of purified HSCs (750 cells) into WBB6F1 and radiosensitive KitW/W-v mice and evaluated the skeleton two months later. Minimal differences were observed between controls and WBB6F1-engrafted mice that received fractionated doses of 2 \u00d7 5 Gy. Kitw/wv mice lost weight and became osteopenic after 2 \u00d7 5 Gy irradiations but these abnormalities were negligible after 5 Gy irradiation. Importantly, adoptive transfer of wild-type cells into Kitw/wv mice restored normal Kit expression in bone marrow. Together, these findings provide strong evidence for efficient engraftment with purified HSCs after lethal TBI with minimal collateral damage to bone. This approach will be useful for investigating mechanisms by which hematopoietic lineage cells regulate bone metabolism.",

        "Abstract": "Based on body weight, morbidly obese leptin-deficient ob/ob mice have less bone than expected, suggesting that leptin plays a role in the skeletal response to weight bearing. To evaluate this possibility, we compared the skeletal response of wild type (WT) and ob/ob mice to hindlimb unloading (HU). Mice were individually housed at 32 \u00b0C (thermoneutral) from 4 weeks of age (rapidly growing) to 16 weeks of age (approaching skeletal maturity). Mice were then randomized into one of 4 groups (n = 10/group): (1) WT control, (2) WT HU, (3) ob/ob control, and (4) ob/ob HU and the results analyzed by 2-way ANOVA. ob/ob mice pair-fed to WT mice had normal cancellous bone volume fraction (BV/TV) in distal femur, lower femur length and total bone area, mineral content (BMC) and density (BMD), and higher cancellous bone volume fraction in lumbar vertebra (LV). HU resulted in lower BMC and BMD in total femur, and lower BV/TV in distal femur and LV in both genotypes. Cancellous bone loss in femur in both genotypes was associated with increases in osteoclast-lined bone perimeter. In summary, leptin deficiency did not attenuate HU-induced osteopenia in male mice, suggesting that leptin is not required for bone loss induced by unweighting.",

        "Abstract": "Mice are a commonly used model to investigate aging-related bone loss but, in contrast to humans, mice exhibit cancellous bone loss prior to skeletal maturity. The mechanisms mediating premature bone loss are not well established. However, our previous work in female mice suggests housing temperature is a critical factor. Premature cancellous bone loss was prevented in female C57BL/6J mice by housing the animals at thermoneutral temperature (where basal rate of energy production is at equilibrium with heat loss). In the present study, we determined if the protective effects of thermoneutral housing extend to males. Male C57BL/6J mice were housed at standard room temperature (22\u00b0C) or thermoneutral (32\u00b0C) conditions from 5 (rapidly growing) to 16 (slowly growing) weeks of age. Mice housed at room temperature exhibited reductions in cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis and fifth lumbar vertebra; these effects were abolished at thermoneutral conditions. Mice housed at thermoneutral temperature had higher levels of bone formation in distal femur (based on histomorphometry) and globally (serum osteocalcin), and lower global levels of bone resorption (serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen) compared to mice housed at room temperature. Thermoneutral housing had no impact on bone marrow adiposity but resulted in higher abdominal white adipose tissue and serum leptin. The overall magnitude of room temperature housing-induced cancellous bone loss did not differ between male (current study) and female (published data) mice. These findings highlight housing temperature as a critical experimental variable in studies using mice of either sex to investigate aging-related changes in bone metabolism.",

        "Abstract": "Mechanical loading of the skeleton during normal weight bearing plays an important role in bone accrual and turnover balance. We recently evaluated bone microarchitecture in the femoral head in 5.6-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats subjected to a 4-day spaceflight aboard STS-41. Compared to weight bearing ground controls, cancellous bone volume fraction was dramatically lower in animals subjected to microgravity. The effects of spaceflight on the rat skeleton are potentially influenced by factors such as age, duration of flight, strain and sex. To test the generalizability of our initial observation, we evaluated archived proximal femora from two additional spaceflight missions: a 10-day mission (STS-57) with 7.5-week-old male Fisher 344 rats, and a 14-day mission (STS-62) with 12-week-old ovariectomized (ovx) female Fisher 344 rats. Cancellous microarchitecture and cortical thickness were assessed using x-ray microtomography/microcomputed tomography. In male rats, cancellous bone volume fraction (bone volume/tissue volume) was lower in flight animals compared to flight controls, but differences were not significant compared to baseline. In ovx female rats, cancellous bone volume fraction was lower in flight animals compared to flight controls and baseline, indicating net bone loss. Cortical thickness did not differ among groups in either experiment. In summary, findings from three separate studies support the conclusion that spaceflight results in cancellous osteopenia in femoral head of growing rats.",

        "Abstract": "Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) levels are higher in distal femur metaphysis of female mice housed at thermoneutral (32\u00b0C) than in mice housed at 22\u00b0C, as are abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) mass, and serum leptin levels. We performed two experiments to explore the role of increased leptin in temperature-enhanced accrual of BMAT. First, we supplemented 6-week-old female C57BL/6J (B6) mice with leptin for 2 weeks at 10 \u00b5g/d using a subcutaneously implanted osmotic pump. Controls consisted of ad libitum (ad lib) fed mice and mice pair fed to match food intake of leptin-supplemented mice. The mice were maintained at 32\u00b0C for the duration of treatment. At necropsy, serum leptin in leptin-supplemented mice did not differ from ad lib mice, suggesting suppression of endogenous leptin production. In support, Ucp1 expression in BAT, percent body fat, and abdominal WAT mass were lower in leptin-supplemented mice. Leptin-supplemented mice also had lower BMAT and higher bone formation in distal femur metaphysis compared to the ad lib group, changes not replicated by pair-feeding. In the second experiment, BMAT response was evaluated in 6-week-old female B6 wild type (WT), leptin-deficient ob/ob and leptin-treated (0.3 \u03bcg/d) ob/ob mice housed at 32\u00b0C for the 2-week duration of the treatment. Compared to mice sacrificed at baseline (22\u00b0C), BMAT increased in ob/ob mice as well as WT mice, indicating a leptin independent response to increased temperature. However, infusion of ob/ob mice with leptin, at a dose rate having negligible effects on either energy metabolism or serum leptin levels, attenuated the increase in BMAT. In summary, increased housing temperature and increased leptin have independent but opposing effects on BMAT in mice.",

        "Abstract": "Mice are typically housed at temperatures well below their thermoneutral zone. When individually housed at room temperature (~22 \u00b0C) mice experience cold stress which results in cancellous bone loss and has the potential to alter the skeletal response to treatment. It is not clear if there is a threshold temperature for cold stress-induced bone loss. It is also not clear if alternative strategies for attenuating cold stress, such as group housing, influence bone accrual and turnover. This study aimed to determine how small differences in temperature (4 \u00b0C) or heat loss (individual versus group housing with nestlets) influence bone in growing female C57BL/6 J mice. Five-week-old mice were randomized by weight to 1 of 4 treatment groups (N = 10/group): 1) baseline, 2) single housed at 22 \u00b0C, 3) single housed at 26 \u00b0C, or 4) group housed (n = 5/cage) with nestlets at 22 \u00b0C. Mice in the baseline group were sacrificed 1 week later, at 6 weeks of age. The other 3 groups of mice were maintained at their respective temperatures and housing conditions for 13 weeks until 18 weeks of age. Compared to baseline, mice single housed at room temperature had increased body weight and femur size, but dramatically decreased cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis. The cancellous bone loss was attenuated but not prevented in mice individually housed at 26 \u00b0C or group housed at 22 \u00b0C. In conclusion, by impacting thermogenesis or heat loss, modest differences in housing conditions could influence experimental results.",

        "Abstract": "Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) is hypothesized to serve as an expandable/contractible fat depot which functions, in part, to minimize energy requirements for sustaining optimal hematopoiesis. We investigated whether BMAT is required for immune reconstitution following injury. Male wild type (WBB6F1, WT) and BMAT-deficient WBB6F1/J-KitW/KitW-v/J (KitW/W-v) mice were lethally irradiated. Irradiation was followed by adoptive transfer of 1000 purified WT hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The extent of immune reconstitution in blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes in the irradiated mice was determined using HSCs from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing mice. We also evaluated skeletal response to treatment. Detection of GFP-positive B and T cells in peripheral blood at 4 and 9 weeks following adoptive transfer and in bone marrow and lymph nodes following necropsy revealed excellent immune reconstitution in both WT and BMAT-deficient mice. Adipocytes were numerous in the distal femur of WT mice but absent or rare in KitW/W-v mice. Bone parameters, including length, mass, density, bone volume, microarchitecture, and turnover balance, exhibited few differences between WT and BMAT-deficient mice. The minimal differences suggest that BMAT is not required for reconstitution of the immune system following lethal radiation and is not a major contributor to the skeletal phenotypes of kit signaling-deficient mice.",

        "Abstract": "Bacteria are able to adapt and survive in harsh and changing environments through many mechanisms, with one of them being horizontal gene transfer (HGT). This process is one of the leading culprits in the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) within bacterial communities and could pose a significant health threat to astronauts if they fell ill, especially on long-duration space missions. In order to better understand the degree of HGT activity that could occur in space, biosafety level-2, donor and recipient bacteria were co-cultured under simulated microgravity (SMG) on Earth with concomitant 1G controls. Two AMR genes, blaOXA-500 and ISAba1, from the donor Acinetobacter pittii, were tracked in four recipient strains of Staphylococcus aureus (which did not harbor those genes) using polymerase chain reaction. All four S. aureus strains that were co-cultured with A. pittii under SMG had a significantly higher number of isolates that were now blaOXA-500- and ISAba1-positive compared to growth at 1G. The acquisition of these genes by the recipient induced a phenotypic change, as these isolates were now resistant to oxacillin, which they were previously susceptible to. This is a novel study, presenting, for the first time, increased HGT activity under SMG and the potential impact of the space environment in promoting increased gene dissemination within bacterial communities.",

        "Abstract": "During space missions, astronauts are faced with a variety of challenges that are unique to spaceflight and that have been known to cause physiological changes in humans over a period of time. Several of these changes occur at the microbiome level, a complex ensemble of microbial communities residing in various anatomic sites of the human body, with a pivotal role in regulating the health and behavior of the host. The microbiome is essential for day-to-day physiological activities, and alterations in microbiome composition and function have been linked to various human diseases. For these reasons, understanding the impact of spaceflight and space conditions on the microbiome of astronauts is important to assess significant health risks that can emerge during long-term missions and to develop countermeasures. Here, we review various conditions that are caused by long-term space exploration and discuss the role of the microbiome in promoting or ameliorating these conditions, as well as space-related factors that impact microbiome composition. The topics explored pertain to microgravity, radiation, immunity, bone health, cognitive function, gender differences and pharmacomicrobiomics. Connections are made between the trifecta of spaceflight, the host and the microbiome, and the significance of these interactions for successful long-term space missions.",

        "Abstract": "Finding sustainable approaches to achieve independence from terrestrial resources is of pivotal importance for the future of space exploration. This is relevant not only to establish viable space exploration beyond low Earth\u2013orbit, but also for ethical considerations associated with the generation of space waste and the preservation of extra-terrestrial environments. Here we propose and highlight a series of microbial biotechnologies uniquely suited to establish sustainable processes for in situ resource utilization and loop-closure. Microbial biotechnologies research and development for space sustainability will be translatable to Earth applications, tackling terrestrial environmental issues, thereby supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.",
        "Conclusion": "With this work, we aimed to advocate the urgency of sustainable approaches for human space exploration, and the essential role microbial biotechnologies could play in this. It has been discussed how microbial biotechnologies may support several processes that, in turn, can help decrease supply chain dependency (from Earth) on long-duration deep-space exploration missions to eventually enable human footholds and settlements across the solar system. In parallel, several of these microbially-supported processes may also help close the loop on LSS and other systems, which can preserve resources and extra-terrestrial environments. These two aspects, independently and together, enable space exploration in a sustainable fashion. To provide appropriate conditions for the maturation of named biotechnologies and to open the field to a wider community, research and innovation are needed. Preliminary studies should be supported in laboratories on Earth, simulation platforms, and in LEO, and full investigations in cis-Lunar space and on the Lunar surface. Augmenting existing space-based facilities to increase the capacity for space experiments, in terms of sample replicates and experimental conditions, should also be considered to improve the impact of the preliminary studies. Funding should take into account the high cost (and time) of genetic engineering and synthetic biology, on which these technologies will likely heavily rely. Finally, the potential of these technologies for terrestrial benefits has been discussed, with specific reference to the United Nation SDGs. If ultra-efficient approaches to sustaining human life and economic activity off-Earth can be adapted towards meaningfully solving problems on our planet, space exploration will have yielded a manifold return on public investments and will thereby become more sustainable not only technologically, but also politically. The debate about the public benefits of space travel and exploration is healthy and necessary, but in the field of sustainability, space advocates may now have an opportunity to win this debate for a generation.",

        "Abstract": "The free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been routinely used to study gene functions, genetic interactions, and conserved signaling pathways. Most experiments require that the animals are synchronized to be at the same specific developmental stage. Bleach synchronization is traditionally used to obtain a population of staged embryos, but the method can have harmful effects on the embryos. The physical separation of differently sized animals is preferred but often difficult to perform because some developmental stages are the same sizes as others. Microfluidic device filters have been used as alternatives, but they are expensive and require customization to scale up the preparation of staged animals. Here, we present a protocol for the synchronization of embryos using mesh filters. Using filtration, we obtained a higher yield of embryos per plate than using the standard bleach synchronization protocol and at a scale beyond microfluidic devices. Importantly, filtration has no deleterious effects on downstream larval development assays. In conclusion, we have exploited the differences in the sizes of C. elegans developmental stages to isolate embryo cultures suitable for use in high-throughput assays.",
        "Conclusion": "Bleach synchronization has been routinely used to obtain a synchronized population of embryos. However, because of the harsh chemical nature of bleach, many parameters need to be carefully controlled to ensure the maximum survival of embryos [2]. By contrast, filtration takes advantage of the size differences among developmental stages, allowing the separation of embryos with minimal exposure to chemical stress. We have demonstrated that filtration is a better alternative to bleaching to scale up preparations of staged C. elegans embryos in terms of embryonic yield per plate and with no deleterious effects on larval development. We optimized our pre-filtration conditions based on the C. elegans reference strain N2 and obtained the highest yield of G1 embryos by incubating 450 P0 embryos at 21.5\u00b0C for three days [29]. However, wild strains and mutants have different egg-laying rates and brood sizes, so the number of P0 embryos to start the assay might need to be adjusted for other strains. We tested two bacterial strains and found OP50 to be the stickiest to help retain the embryos. Other bacteria might be stickier and should be tested in the future. All our assays were done on 6 cm plates. Higher embryo yields can be obtained by using 10 cm or larger plates. We have applied our technique to harvest embryos from C. elegans. However, embryos from other Caenorhabditis species that have similar dimensions to C. elegans (e.g., C. briggsae) can also be isolated. Additionally, the technique could also be adapted to isolate embryos with smaller or larger dimensions by altering the mesh sizes. In summary, our technique provides a robust way of collecting large numbers of C. elegans embryos with high purity without the need to subject the animals to bleach.",

        "Abstract": "Muscle strength is a functional measure of quality of life in humans. Declines in muscle strength are manifested in diseases as well as during inactivity, aging, and space travel. With conserved muscle biology, the simple genetic model C. elegans is a high throughput platform in which to identify molecular mechanisms causing muscle strength loss and to develop interventions based on diet, exercise, and drugs. In the clinic, standardized strength measures are essential to quantitate changes in patients; however, analogous standards have not been recapitulated in the C. elegans model since force generation fluctuates based on animal behavior and locomotion. Here, we report a microfluidics-based system for strength measurement that we call \u2018NemaFlex\u2019, based on pillar deflection as the nematode crawls through a forest of pillars. We have optimized the micropillar forest design and identified robust measurement conditions that yield a measure of strength that is independent of behavior and gait. Validation studies using a muscle contracting agent and mutants confirm that NemaFlex can reliably score muscular strength in C. elegans. Additionally, we report a scaling factor to account for animal size that is consistent with a biomechanics model and enables comparative strength studies of mutants. Taken together, our findings anchor NemaFlex for applications in genetic and drug screens, for defining molecular and cellular circuits of neuromuscular function, and for dissection of degenerative processes in disuse, aging, and disease.",

        "Abstract": "Biology experiments in space seek to increase our understanding of what happens to life beyond Earth and how we can safely send life beyond Earth. Spaceflight is associated with many (mal)adaptations in physiology, including decline in musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, vestibular, and immune systems. Biological experiments in space are inherently challenging to implement. Development of hardware and validation of experimental conditions are critical to ensure the collection of high-quality data. The model organism Caenorhabditis elegans has been studied in space for more than 20 years to better understand spaceflight-induced (patho)physiology, particularly spaceflight-induced muscle decline. These experiments have used a variety of hardware configurations. Despite this, hardware used in the past was not available for our most recent experiment, the Molecular Muscle Experiment (MME). Therefore, we had to design and validate flight hardware for MME. MME provides a contemporary example of many of the challenges faced by researchers conducting C. elegans experiments onboard the International Space Station. Here, we describe the hardware selection and validation, in addition to the ground-based experiment scientific validation testing. These experiences and operational solutions allow others to replicate and/or improve our experimental design on future missions.",

        "Abstract": "Aging and healthspan are determined by both environmental and genetic factors. The insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1) pathway is a key mediator of aging in Caenorhabditis elegans and mammals. Specifically, DAF-2 signaling, an ortholog of human IGF, controls DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor, a master regulator of metabolism and longevity. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are both linked to aging. We propose that daily supplementation of tart cherry extract (TCE), rich in anthocyanins with antioxidant properties may exert dual benefits for mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, resulting in beneficial effects on aging in C. elegans. We found that TCE supplementation at 6 \u03bcg or 12 \u03bcg/mL, increased (p < 0.05) the mean lifespan of wild type N2 worms, respectively, when compared to untreated control worms. Consistent with these findings, TCE upregulated (p < 0.05) expression of longevity-related genes such as daf-16 and aak-2 (but not daf-2 or akt-1 genes) and genes related to oxidative stress such as sod-2. Further, we showed that TCE supplementation increased spare respiration in N2 worms. However, TCE did not change the mean lifespan of daf-16 and aak-2 mutant worms. In conclusion, our findings indicate that TCE confers healthspan benefits in C. elegans through enhanced mitochondrial function and reduced oxidative stress, mainly via the DAF-16 pathway.",

        "Abstract": "In C. elegans, unc-89 encodes a set of giant multi-domain proteins (up 8,081 residues) localized to the M-lines of muscle sarcomeres and required for normal sarcomere organization and whole-animal locomotion. Multiple UNC-89 isoforms contain two protein kinase domains. There is conservation in arrangement of domains between UNC-89 and its two mammalian homologs, obscurin and SPEG: kinase, a non-domain region of 647\u2013742 residues, Ig domain, Fn3 domain and a second kinase domain. In all three proteins, this non-domain \u201cinterkinase region\u201d has low sequence complexity, high proline content and lacks predicted secondary structure. We report that a major portion of this interkinase (571 residues out of 647 residues) when examined by single molecule force spectroscopy in vitro displays the properties of a random coil and acts as an entropic spring. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to create nematodes carrying an in-frame deletion of the same 571-residue portion of the interkinase. These animals display severe disorganization of all portions of the sarcomere in body wall muscle. Super-resolution microscopy reveals extra, short-A-bands lying close to the outer muscle cell membrane and between normally spaced A-bands. Nematodes with this in-frame deletion show defective locomotion and muscle force generation. We designed our CRISPR-generated in-frame deletion to contain an HA tag at the N-terminus of the large UNC-89 isoforms. This HA tag results in normal organization of body wall muscle, but approximately half the normal levels of the giant UNC-89 isoforms, dis-organization of pharyngeal muscle, small body size, and reduced muscle force, likely due to poor nutritional uptake.",

        "Abstract": "In this study, we report a microfluidic device for the whole-life culture of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that allows the scoring of animal survival and health measures. This device referred to as the NemaLife chip features: (1) an optimized micropillar arena in which animals can crawl, (2) sieve channels that separate progeny and prevent the loss of adults from the arena during culture maintenance, and (3) ports that allow rapid accessibility for feeding the adult-only population and introducing reagents as needed. The pillar arena geometry was optimized to accommodate the growing body size during culture and emulate the body gait and locomotion of animals reared on agar. Likewise, feeding protocols were optimized to recapitulate longevity outcomes typical of standard plate growth. Key benefits of the NemaLife Chip include eliminating the need to perform repeated manual transfers of adults during survival assays, negating the need for progeny-blocking chemical interventions, and avoiding the swim-induced stress across lifespan in animals reared in liquid. We also show that the culture of animals in pillar-less microfluidic chambers reduces lifespan and introduces physiological stress by increasing the occurrence of age-related vulval integrity disorder. We validated our pillar-based device with longevity analyses of classical aging mutants (daf-2, age-1, eat-2, and daf-16) and animals subjected to RNAi knockdown of age-related genes (age-1 and daf-16). We also showed that healthspan measures such as pharyngeal pumping and tap-induced stimulated reversals can be scored across the lifespan in the NemaLife chip. Overall, the capacity to generate reliable lifespan and physiological data underscores the potential of the NemaLife chip to accelerate healthspan and lifespan investigations in C. elegans.",
        "Conclusion": "We demonstrated that C. elegans can be effectively maintained in our NemaLife microfluidic device across its lifespan without using chemicals (progeny-blocking drugs, antibacterial agents, antifungal compounds, etc.) in an environment that recapitulates longevity on agar plates. The closed microfluidic environment keeps animals inside the arena boundary and eliminates the events of death by desiccation. Being fully occupied with fluid, the culture environment maintains uniform humidity and minimizes temperature fluctuations. Micropillars in the microfluidic device enable the animals to maintain natural crawling gaits and eliminate swim-induced stress. The well characterized survival outcomes of \u201ccornerstone\u201d longevity mutants with altered insulin-like signaling or dietary restriction pathways grown on agar are reproduced in the device; RNAi can also be executed. The capacity for manual injections of fluids and food enables investigator control over feeding conditions or introduced drugs. For compound testing, the liquid environment in the NemaLife chip ensures the uniform availability of the compound which is difficult to ensure in agar-filled plates. In the NemaLife chip, we replace the old environment (larva, eggs, 24 h old bacteria and buffer, pheromones, excrete etc.) daily with fresh food. As a result, animals can be exposed to a fresh dose of compounds daily, similar to dosing schedules with mammalian models. An added benefit of the device is that progeny and effluent (containing any chemicals such as, pheromones etc.) might be collected for downstream analysis. The NemaLife chip was also designed to improve the scoring of live/dead animals. The microfluidic chip consists of 9 smaller chambers on a 2\" \u00d7 3\" glass slide. Small footprint of an individual chamber is entirely visible at 10 \u00d7 or 20 \u00d7 magnification on a stereomicroscope. Each chamber was optimized to house 10\u201315 animals so that one can score animal surival easily. Thus, we achieve a large enough sample size for drawing meaningful statistical inferences without employing a computer vision system and complicated imaging system otherwise required for a larger chamber. These considerations make the NemaLife chip easily implementable in research labs conducting lifespan assays and investigator scoring options provide quality control on data. In sum, the NemaLife chip is a simple and low-cost means to obtain reliable lifespan and physiological data on aging animals. The NemaLife chip can be developed into a fully automated platform, that can offer progeny removal, feeding, drug delivery, and phenotypic scoring using automated pump systems and an appropriate software. Thus, the NemaLife chip has a significant potential both as a low-cost \u201cmanual\u201d device that can be used in many labs and as a core component of a fully automated platform.",

        "Abstract": "Summary Extended space travel is a goal of government space agencies and private companies. However, spaceflight poses risks to human health, and the effects on the nervous system have to be better characterized. Here, we exploited the unique experimental advantages of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to explore how spaceflight affects adult neurons in vivo. We found that animals that lived 5 days of adulthood on the International Space Station exhibited hyperbranching in PVD and touch receptor neurons. We also found that, in the presence of a neuronal proteotoxic stress, spaceflight promotes a remarkable accumulation of neuronal-derived waste in the surrounding tissues, suggesting an impaired transcellular degradation of debris released from neurons. Our data reveal that spaceflight can significantly affect adult neuronal morphology and clearance of neuronal trash, highlighting the need to carefully assess the risks of long-duration spaceflight on the nervous system and to develop adequate countermeasures for safe space exploration.",

        "Abstract": "Caenorhabditis elegans is a low-cost genetic model that has been flown to the International Space Station to investigate the influence of microgravity on changes in the expression of genes involved in muscle maintenance. These studies showed that genes that encode muscle attachment complexes have decreased expression under microgravity. However, it remains to be answered whether the decreased expression leads to concomitant changes in animal muscle strength, specifically across multiple generations. We recently reported the NemaFlex microfluidic device for the measurement of muscle strength of C. elegans (Rahman et al., Lab Chip, 2018). In this study, we redesign our original NemaFlex device and integrate it with flow control hardware for spaceflight investigations considering mixed animal culture, constraints on astronaut time, crew safety, and on-orbit operations. The technical advances we have made include (i) a microfluidic device design that allows animals of a given size to be sorted from unsynchronized cultures and housed in individual chambers, (ii) a fluid handling protocol for injecting the suspension of animals into the microfluidic device that prevents channel clogging, introduction of bubbles, and crowding of animals in the chambers, and (iii) a custom-built worm-loading apparatus interfaced with the microfluidic device that allows easy manipulation of the worm suspension and prevents fluid leakage into the surrounding environment. Collectively, these technical advances enabled the development of new microfluidics-integrated hardware for spaceflight studies in C. elegans. Finally, we report Earth-based validation studies to test this new hardware, which has led to it being flown to the International Space Station.",

        "Abstract": "The model organism Caenorhabditis elegans is used in a variety of applications ranging from fundamental biological studies, to drug screening, to disease modeling, and to space-biology investigations. These applications rely on conducting whole-organism phenotypic assays involving animal behavior and locomotion. In this study, we report a 3D printed compact imaging platform (CIP) that is integrated with a smart-device camera for the whole-organism phenotyping of C. elegans. The CIP has no external optical elements and does not require mechanical focusing, simplifying the optical configuration. The small footprint of the system powered with a standard USB provides capabilities ranging from plug-and-play, to parallel operation, and to housing it in incubators for temperature control. We demonstrate on Earth the compatibility of the CIP with different C. elegans substrates, including agar plates, liquid droplets on glass slides and microfluidic chips. We validate the system with behavioral and thrashing assays and show that the phenotypic readouts are in good agreement with the literature data. We conduct a pilot study with mutants and show that the phenotypic data collected from the CIP distinguishes these mutants. Finally, we discuss how the simplicity and versatility offered by CIP makes it amenable to future C. elegans investigations on the International Space Station, where science experiments are constrained by system size, payload weight and crew time. Overall, the compactness, portability and ease-of-use makes the CIP desirable for research and educational outreach applications on Earth and in space.",

Mitochondrial decline has long been associated with age-related health loss. We show that small, clinically meaningful doses of a mitochondrion-targeting sulfur donor (AP39) extend Caenorhabditis elegans health in older age, which act by maintaining mitochondrial integrity. Adult onset of AP39 delivery, when mitochondrial and cell structural dysfunction are already manifested, also promoted healthy aging. Distinct association of health span extension with mitochondria, cytoskeletal and peroxisome molecular profiles, under regulation of the elt-6/elt-3 transcription factor regulatory circuit, further distinguished adult-onset AP39 therapy. Our results establish a framework for forward translating mitochondrial sulfide as a potentially viable healthy aging intervention in mammals.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract BackgroundAge\u2010related muscle decline (sarcopenia) associates with numerous health risk factors and poor quality of life. Drugs that counter sarcopenia without harmful side effects are lacking, and repurposing existing pharmaceuticals could expedite realistic clinical options. Recent studies suggest bisphosphonates promote muscle health; however, the efficacy of bisphosphonates as an anti\u2010sarcopenic therapy is currently unclear. MethodsUsing Caenorhabditis elegans as a sarcopenia model, we treated animals with 100 nM, 1, 10, 100 and 500 \u03bcM zoledronic acid (ZA) and assessed lifespan and healthspan (movement rates) using a microfluidic chip device. The effects of ZA on sarcopenia were examined using GFP\u2010tagged myofibres or mitochondria at days 0, 4 and 6 post\u2010adulthood. Mechanisms of ZA\u2010mediated healthspan extension were determined using combined ZA and targeted RNAi gene knockdown across the life\u2010course. ResultsWe found 100 nM and 1 \u03bcM ZA increased lifespan (P < 0.001) and healthspan [954 \u00b1 53 (100 nM) and 963 \u00b1 48 (1 \u03bcM) vs. 834 \u00b1 59% (untreated) population activity AUC, P < 0.05]. 10 \u03bcM ZA shortened lifespan (P < 0.0001) but not healthspan (758.9 \u00b1 37 vs. 834 \u00b1 59, P > 0.05), whereas 100 and 500 \u03bcM ZA were larval lethal. ZA (1 \u03bcM) significantly improved myofibrillar structure on days 4 and 6 post\u2010adulthood (83 and 71% well\u2010organized myofibres, respectively, vs. 56 and 34% controls, P < 0.0001) and increased well\u2010networked mitochondria at day 6 (47 vs. 16% in controls, P < 0.01). Genes required for ZA\u2010mediated healthspan extension included fdps\u20101/FDPS\u20101 (278 \u00b1 9 vs. 894 \u00b1 17% population activity AUC in knockdown + 1 \u03bcM ZA vs. untreated controls, respectively, P < 0.0001), daf\u201016/FOXO (680 \u00b1 16 vs. 894 \u00b1 17%, P < 0.01) and agxt\u20102/BAIBA (531 \u00b1 23 vs. 552 \u00b1 8%, P > 0.05). Life/healthspan was extended through knockdown of igdb\u20101/FNDC5 (635 \u00b1 10 vs. 523 \u00b1 10% population activity AUC in gene knockdown vs. untreated controls, P < 0.01) and sir\u20102.3/SIRT\u20104 (586 \u00b1 10 vs. 523 \u00b1 10%, P < 0.05), with no synergistic improvements in ZA co\u2010treatment vs. knockdown alone [651 \u00b1 12 vs. 635 \u00b1 10% (igdb\u20101/FNDC5) and 583 \u00b1 9 vs. 586 \u00b1 10% (sir\u20102.3/SIRT\u20104), both P > 0.05]. Conversely, let\u2010756/FGF21 and sir\u20102.2/SIRT\u20104 were dispensable for ZA\u2010induced healthspan [630 \u00b1 6 vs. 523 \u00b1 10% population activity AUC in knockdown + 1 \u03bcM ZA vs. untreated controls, P < 0.01 (let\u2010756/FGF21) and 568 \u00b1 9 vs. 523 \u00b1 10%, P < 0.05 (sir\u20102.2/SIRT\u20104)]. ConclusionsDespite lacking an endoskeleton, ZA delays Caenorhabditis elegans sarcopenia, which translates to improved neuromuscular function across the life course. Bisphosphonates might, therefore, be an immediately exploitable anti\u2010sarcopenia therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract Background: Understanding and countering the well-established negative health consequences of spaceflight remains a primary challenge preventing safe deep space exploration. Targeted/personalized therapeutics are at the forefront of space medicine strategies, and cross-species molecular signatures now define the \u2018typical\u2019 spaceflight response. However, a lack of direct genotype\u2013phenotype associations currently limits the robustness and, therefore, the therapeutic utility of putative mechanisms underpinning pathological changes in flight. Methods: We employed the worm Caenorhabditis elegans as a validated model of space biology, combined with \u2018NemaFlex-S\u2019 microfluidic devices for assessing animal strength production as one of the most reproducible physiological responses to spaceflight. Wild-type and dys-1 (BZ33) strains (a Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) model for comparing predisposed muscle weak animals) were cultured on the International Space Station in chemically defined media before loading second-generation gravid adults into NemaFlex-S devices to assess individual animal strength. These same cultures were then frozen on orbit before returning to Earth for next-generation sequencing transcriptomic analysis. Results: Neuromuscular strength was lower in flight versus ground controls (16.6% decline, p < 0.05), with dys-1 significantly more (23% less strength, p < 0.01) affected than wild types. The transcriptional gene ontology signatures characterizing both strains of weaker animals in flight strongly corroborate previous results across species, enriched for upregulated stress response pathways and downregulated mitochondrial and cytoskeletal processes. Functional gene cluster analysis extended this to implicate decreased neuronal function, including abnormal calcium handling and acetylcholine signaling, in space-induced strength declines under the predicted control of UNC-89 and DAF-19 transcription factors. Finally, gene modules specifically altered in dys-1 animals in flight again cluster to neuronal/neuromuscular pathways, suggesting strength loss in DMD comprises a strong neuronal component that predisposes these animals to exacerbated strength loss in space. Conclusions: Highly reproducible gene signatures are strongly associated with space-induced neuromuscular strength loss across species and neuronal changes in calcium/acetylcholine signaling require further study. These results promote targeted medical efforts towards and provide an in vivo model for safely sending animals and people into deep space in the near future.",

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT While numerous health-beneficial interactions between host and microbiota have been identified, there is still a lack of targeted approaches for modulating these interactions. Thus, we here identify precision prebiotics that specifically modulate the abundance of a microbiome member species of interest. In the first step, we show that defining precision prebiotics by compounds that are only taken up by the target species but no other species in a community is usually not possible due to overlapping metabolic niches. Subsequently, we use metabolic modeling to identify precision prebiotics for a two-member Caenorhabditis elegans microbiome community comprising the immune-protective target species Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 and the persistent colonizer Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71. We experimentally confirm four of the predicted precision prebiotics, L-serine, L-threonine, D-mannitol, and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid, to specifically increase the abundance of MYb11. L-serine was further assessed in vivo, leading to an increase in MYb11 abundance also in the worm host. Overall, our findings demonstrate that metabolic modeling is an effective tool for the design of precision prebiotics as an important cornerstone for future microbiome-targeted therapies. IMPORTANCEWhile various mechanisms through which the microbiome influences disease processes in the host have been identified, there are still only few approaches that allow for targeted manipulation of microbiome composition as a first step toward microbiome-based therapies. Here, we propose the concept of precision prebiotics that allow to boost the abundance of already resident health-beneficial microbial species in a microbiome. We present a constraint-based modeling pipeline to predict precision prebiotics for a minimal microbial community in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans comprising the host-beneficial Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 and the persistent colonizer Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71 with the aim to boost the growth of MYb11. Experimentally testing four of the predicted precision prebiotics, we confirm that they are specifically able to increase the abundance of MYb11 in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate that constraint-based modeling could be an important tool for the development of targeted microbiome-based therapies against human diseases.",

The biology driving the frequency of skin issues in astronauts is currently not well understood. MethodsTo address this issue, we used a systems biology approach utilizing NASA\u2019s Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) on space flown murine transcriptomic datasets focused on the skin, biochemical profiles of 50 NASA astronauts and human transcriptomic datasets generated from blood and hair samples of JAXA astronauts, as well as blood samples obtained from the NASA Twins Study, and skin and blood samples from the first civilian commercial mission, Inspiration4. ResultsKey biological changes related to skin health, DNA damage & repair, and mitochondrial dysregulation are identified as potential drivers for skin health risks during spaceflight. Additionally, a machine learning model is utilized to determine gene pairings associated with spaceflight response in the skin. While we identified spaceflight-induced dysregulation, such as alterations in genes associated with skin barrier function and collagen formation, our results also highlight the remarkable ability for organisms to re-adapt back to Earth via post-flight re-tuning of gene expression. ConclusionOur findings can guide future research on developing countermeasures for mitigating spaceflight-associated skin damage.",

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT In the wild, C. elegans are emersed in environments teeming with a veritable menagerie of microorganisms. The C. elegans cuticular surface serves as a barrier and first point of contact with their microbial environments. In this study, we identify microbes from C. elegans natural habitats that associate with its cuticle, constituting a simple \u201cskin microbiome.\u201d We rear our animals on a modified CeMbio, mCeMbio, a consortium of ecologically relevant microbes. We first combine standard microbiological methods with an adapted micro skin-swabbing tool to describe the skin-resident bacteria on the C. elegans surface. Furthermore, we conduct 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies to identify relative shifts in the proportion of mCeMbio bacteria upon surface-sterilization, implying distinct skin- and gut-microbiomes. We find that some strains of bacteria, including Enterobacter sp. JUb101, are primarily found on the nematode skin, while others like Stenotrophomonas indicatrix JUb19 and Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71 are predominantly found in the animal\u2019s gut. Finally, we show that this skin microbiome promotes host cuticle integrity in harsh environments. Together, we identify a skin microbiome for the well-studied nematode model and propose its value in conferring host fitness advantages in naturalized contexts. IMPORTANCEThe genetic model organism C. elegans has recently emerged as a tool for understanding host\u2013microbiome interactions. Nearly all of these studies either focus on pathogenic or gut-resident microbes. Little is known about the existence of native, nonpathogenic skin microbes or their function. We demonstrate that members of a modified C. elegans model microbiome, mCeMbio, can adhere to the animal's cuticle and confer protection from noxious environments. We combine a novel micro-swab tool, the first 16S microbial sequencing data from relatively unperturbed C. elegans, and physiological assays to demonstrate microbially mediated protection of the skin. This work serves as a foundation to explore wild C. elegans skin microbiomes and use C. elegans as a model for skin research.",

        "Abstract": "UNC-89 is a giant sarcomeric M-line protein required for sarcomere organization and optimal muscle function. UNC-89 contains two protein kinase domains, PK1 and PK2, separated by an elastic region. Here we show that PK2 is a canonical kinase expected to be catalytically active. C. elegans expressing UNC-89 with a lysine to alanine (KtoA) mutation to inactivate PK2 have normally organized sarcomeres and SR, and normal muscle function. PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented mitochondria, correlated with more mitochondrially-associated DRP-1. PK2 KtoA mutants have increased ATP levels, increased glycolysis and altered levels of electron transport chain complexes. Muscle mitochondria show increased complex I and decreased complex II basal respiration, each of which cannot be uncoupled. This suggests that mutant mitochondria are already uncoupled, possibly resulting from an increased level of the uncoupling protein, UCP-4. Our results suggest signaling from sarcomeres to mitochondria, to help match energy requirements with energy production.",

        "Abstract": "The advent of phylogenetic DNA microarrays and high-throughput pyrosequencing technologies has dramatically increased the resolution and accuracy of detection of distinct microbial lineages in mixed microbial assemblages. Despite an expanding array of approaches for detecting microbes in a given sample, rapid and robust means of assessing the differential viability of these cells, as a function of phylogenetic lineage, remain elusive. In this study, pre-PCR propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment was coupled with downstream pyrosequencing and PhyloChip DNA microarray analyses to better understand the frequency, diversity and distribution of viable bacteria in spacecraft assembly cleanrooms. Sample fractions not treated with PMA, which were indicative of the presence of both live and dead cells, yielded a great abundance of highly diverse bacterial pyrosequences. In contrast, only 1% to 10% of all of the pyrosequencing reads, arising from a few robust bacterial lineages, originated from sample fractions that had been pre-treated with PMA. The results of PhyloChip analyses of PMA-treated and -untreated sample fractions were in agreement with those of pyrosequencing. The viable bacterial population detected in cleanrooms devoid of spacecraft hardware was far more diverse than that observed in cleanrooms that housed mission-critical spacecraft hardware. The latter was dominated by hardy, robust organisms previously reported to survive in oligotrophic cleanroom environments. Presented here are the findings of the first ever comprehensive effort to assess the viability of cells in low-biomass environmental samples, and correlate differential viability with phylogenetic affiliation.",

        "Abstract": "Mouse models are critical tools in tuberculosis (TB) research. Recent studies have demonstrated that the wild mouse gut microbiota promotes host fitness and improves disease resistance. Here we examine whether the wild mouse gut microbiota alters the immunopathology of TB in BALB/c mice. Conventional BALB/c mice (LabC) and mice born to germ-free BALB/c mothers reconstituted with the wild mouse gut microbiota (WildR) were used in our studies. WildR mice controlled initial TB infection better than LabC mice. The microbial gut communities of LabC mice and WildR mice had similar richness but significantly different composition prior to infection. TB reduced the gut community richness in both cohorts while differences in community composition remained indicating a general TB-induced dysbiosis. The wild mouse gut microbiota did not alter the typical lung histopathology of TB in the BALB/c model that includes unstructured immune cell infiltrates with infected foamy macrophages invading alveolar spaces. Animals of both cohorts mounted robust T cell responses in lungs and spleen with lower absolute counts of CD4 and CD8 T cells in lungs of WildR mice during acute infection, corresponding with observed differences in pathogen load. In summary, LabC mice and WildR mice showed largely overlapping TB immunopathology and pathogen kinetics, with WildR mice controlling early acute infection better than LabC mice.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundThe International Space Station (ISS) is a unique built environment due to the effects of microgravity, space radiation, elevated carbon dioxide levels, and especially continuous human habitation. Understanding the composition of the ISS microbial community will facilitate further development of safety and maintenance practices. The primary goal of this study was to characterize the viable microbiome of the ISS-built environment. A second objective was to determine if the built environments of Earth-based cleanrooms associated with space exploration are an appropriate model of the ISS environment. ResultsSamples collected from the ISS and two cleanrooms at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, Pasadena, CA) were analyzed by traditional cultivation, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and propidium monoazide\u2013quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PMA-qPCR) assays to estimate viable microbial populations. The 16S rRNA gene Illumina iTag sequencing was used to elucidate microbial diversity and explore differences between ISS and cleanroom microbiomes. Statistical analyses showed that members of the phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria were dominant in the samples examined but varied in abundance. Actinobacteria were predominant in the ISS samples whereas Proteobacteria, least abundant in the ISS, dominated in the cleanroom samples. The viable bacterial populations seen by PMA treatment were greatly decreased. However, the treatment did not appear to have an effect on the bacterial composition (diversity) associated with each sampling site. ConclusionsThe results of this study provide strong evidence that specific human skin-associated microorganisms make a substantial contribution to the ISS microbiome, which is not the case in Earth-based cleanrooms. For example, Corynebacterium and Propionibacterium (Actinobacteria) but not Staphylococcus (Firmicutes) species are dominant on the ISS in terms of viable and total bacterial community composition. The results obtained will facilitate future studies to determine how stable the ISS environment is over time. The present results also demonstrate the value of measuring viable cell diversity and population size at any sampling site. This information can be used to identify sites that can be targeted for more stringent cleaning. Finally, the results will allow comparisons with other built sites and facilitate future improvements on the ISS that will ensure astronaut health.

        "Conclusion": "This study provided important insight into the ISS microbial diversity with a focus on significant differences between the closed habitats of the ISS and Earth-based cleanrooms. The NGS data, supported by traditional microbiology techniques and selective molecular bioburden estimation assays, provided a preliminary but detailed report on the ISS environmental microbiome. Future work will be able to build on these initial results by determining how stable that environment is over time. In contrast with the JPL cleanrooms, the most common organisms in the ISS environment were members of the Actinobacteria that are frequently associated with humans. As on the ISS, human traffic is common in the cleanrooms, but clearly the more stringent procedures possible on Earth are more effective in eradicating these organisms. The current results provide a baseline for evaluating the effectiveness of future ISS procedural changes. This study also allowed an evaluation of the utility of coupling PMA treatment with NGS sequencing for more accurate estimation of viable population. The bacterial diversity of each sample decreased after the PMA treatment but this was strongly associated with the sampling site. Since exposure to viable organisms is best minimized, it is important to know which areas are most problematic and hence should be avoided and/or targeted for more stringent cleaning conditions. It is clear from the results presented here that viable cell studies with PMA can provide this information. It was also found that the relative numbers of various types of viable cells in each sample closely resembled the distribution obtained when all (dead and viable) cells were considered. This is likely to be a usual result unless the population at a sampling site has been recently and dramatically changed such that the prior dominant organisms have been replaced in only the pool of viable cells.",

The low-nutrient environment combined with enhanced irradiation and microgravity may trigger changes in the molecular suite of microorganisms leading to increased virulence and resistance of microbes. Proteomic characterization of two Aspergillus fumigatus strains, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, isolated from HEPA filter debris and cupola surface of the ISS, respectively, is presented, along with a comparison to experimentally established clinical isolates Af293 and CEA10. In-depth analysis highlights variations in the proteome of both ISS-isolated strains when compared to the clinical strains. Proteins that showed increased abundance in ISS isolates were overall involved in stress responses, and carbohydrate and secondary metabolism. Among the most abundant proteins were Pst2 and ArtA involved in oxidative stress response, PdcA and AcuE responsible for ethanol fermentation and glyoxylate cycle, respectively, TpcA, TpcF, and TpcK that are part of trypacidin biosynthetic pathway, and a toxin Asp-hemolysin.

        "Abstract": "BackgroundAn inflatable lunar/Mars analog habitat (ILMAH), simulated closed system isolated by HEPA filtration, mimics International Space Station (ISS) conditions and future human habitation on other planets except for the exchange of air between outdoor and indoor environments. The ILMAH was primarily commissioned to measure physiological, psychological, and immunological characteristics of human inhabiting in isolation, but it was also available for other studies such as examining its microbiological aspects. Characterizing and understanding possible changes and succession of fungal species is of high importance since fungi are not only hazardous to inhabitants but also deteriorate the habitats. Observing the mycobiome changes in the presence of human will enable developing appropriate countermeasures with reference to crew health in a future closed habitat. ResultsSuccession of fungi was characterized utilizing both traditional and state-of-the-art molecular techniques during the 30-day human occupation of the ILMAH. Surface samples were collected at various time points and locations to observe both the total and viable fungal populations of common environmental and opportunistic pathogenic species. To estimate the cultivable fungal population, potato dextrose agar plate counts method was utilized. The internal transcribed spacer region-based iTag Illumina sequencing was employed to measure the community structure and fluctuation of the mycobiome over time in various locations. Treatment of samples with propidium monoazide (PMA; a DNA intercalating dye for selective detection of viable microbial populations) had a significant effect on the microbial diversity compared to non-PMA-treated samples. Statistical analysis confirmed that viable fungal community structure changed (increase in diversity and decrease in fungal burden) over the occupation time. Samples collected at day 20 showed distinct fungal profiles from samples collected at any other time point (before or after). Viable fungal families like Davidiellaceae, Teratosphaeriaceae, Pleosporales, and Pleosporaceae were shown to increase during the occupation time. ConclusionsThe results of this study revealed that the overall fungal diversity in the closed habitat changed during human presence; therefore, it is crucial to properly maintain a closed habitat to preserve it from deteriorating and keep it safe for its inhabitants. Differences in community profiles were observed when statistically treated, especially of the mycobiome of samples collected at day 20. On a genus level Epiccocum, Alternaria, Pleosporales, Davidiella, and Cryptococcus showed increased abundance over the occupation time.

        "Conclusion": "Accumulation of viable mycobiome during the experiment duration and differences in fungal community profiles were observed. On a genus level, Epiccocum, Alternaria, Pleosporales, Davidiella, and Cryptococcus showed increased abundance over the occupation time. Unlike results of molecular analyses, cultivable fungi counts decreased over time. Epicoccum nigrum was the most dominant cultivable isolate; however, most of the fungal species detected via molecular approach were not cultured. During human presence, the overall fungal diversity has changed, that in the long run, may lead to a conclusion that proper maintenance protocols of a closed habitat may be required to preserve it from deteriorating and keep it safe for its inhabitants.",

The International Space Station (ISS) is an isolated, closed human habitat that can be harnessed for cross-sectional and longitudinal functional microbiome studies. Using NASA-archived microbial isolates collected from the ISS potable water system over several years, we profiled five phenotypes: antibiotic resistance, metabolism, hemolysis, and biofilm structure/composition of individual or multispecies communities, which represent characteristics that could negatively impact astronaut health and life-support systems. Data revealed a temporal dependence on interactive behaviors, suggesting possible microbial adaptation over time within the ecosystem. This study represents one of the most extensive phenotypic characterization of ISS potable water microbiota with implications for microbial risk assessments of water systems in built environments in space and on Earth.",

Many studies that attempt to evaluate these low-biomass microbiome samples are riddled with erroneous results that are typically false positive signals obtained during the sampling process. We have investigated various low-biomass kits and methods to determine the limit of detection of these pipelines. Here we present KatharoSeq, a high-throughput protocol combining laboratory and bioinformatic methods that can differentiate a true positive signal in samples with as few as 50 to 500 cells. We demonstrate the application of this method in three unique low-biomass environments, including a SAF, a hospital NICU, and an abalone-rearing facility.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundThe International Space Station (ISS) is a unique and complex built environment with the ISS surface microbiome originating from crew and cargo or from life support recirculation in an almost entirely closed system. The Microbial Tracking 1 (MT-1) project was the first ISS environmental surface study to report on the metagenome profiles without using whole-genome amplification. The study surveyed the microbial communities from eight surfaces over a 14-month period. The Microbial Tracking 2 (MT-2) project aimed to continue the work of MT-1, sampling an additional four flights from the same locations, over another 14 months. MethodsEight surfaces across the ISS were sampled with sterile wipes and processed upon return to Earth. DNA extracted from the processed samples (and controls) were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA) to detect intact/viable cells or left untreated and to detect the total DNA population (free DNA/compromised cells/intact cells/viable cells). DNA extracted from PMA-treated and untreated samples were analyzed using shotgun metagenomics. Samples were cultured for bacteria and fungi to supplement the above results. ResultsStaphylococcus sp. and Malassezia sp. were the most represented bacterial and fungal species, respectively, on the ISS. Overall, the ISS surface microbiome was dominated by organisms associated with the human skin. Multi-dimensional scaling and differential abundance analysis showed significant temporal changes in the microbial population but no spatial differences. The ISS antimicrobial resistance gene profiles were however more stable over time, with no differences over the 5-year span of the MT-1 and MT-2 studies. Twenty-nine antimicrobial resistance genes were detected across all samples, with macrolide/lincosamide/streptogramin resistance being the most widespread. Metagenomic assembled genomes were reconstructed from the dataset, resulting in 82 MAGs. Functional assessment of the collective MAGs showed a propensity for amino acid utilization over carbohydrate metabolism. Co-occurrence analyses showed strong associations between bacterial and fungal genera. Culture analysis showed the microbial load to be on average 3.0 \u00d7 105 cfu/m2 ConclusionsUtilizing various metagenomics analyses and culture methods, we provided a comprehensive analysis of the ISS surface microbiome, showing microbial burden, bacterial and fungal species prevalence, changes in the microbiome, and resistome over time and space, as well as the functional capabilities and microbial interactions of this unique built microbiome. Data from this study may help to inform policies for future space missions to ensure an ISS surface microbiome that promotes astronaut health and spacecraft integrity.

The analysis revealed enhanced production levels of naphtho-\u03b3-pyrones and therapeutically relevant SMs, including bicoumanigrin A, aurasperones A and B, and the antioxidant pyranonigrin A. Genetic variants that may be responsible for increased SM production levels in JSC-093350089 were identified. These findings include INDELs within the predicted promoter region of flbA, which encodes a developmental regulator that modulates pyranonigrin A production via regulation of Fum21. The pyranonigrin A biosynthetic gene cluster was confirmed in A. niger, which revealed the involvement of a previously undescribed gene, pyrE, in its biosynthesis. UVC sensitivity assays enabled characterization of pyranonigrin A as a UV resistance agent in the ISS isolate.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundThe antimicrobial resistance (AMR) phenotypic properties, multiple drug resistance (MDR) gene profiles, and genes related to potential virulence and pathogenic properties of five Enterobacter bugandensis strains isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) were carried out and compared with genomes of three clinical strains. Whole genome sequences of ISS strains were characterized using the hybrid de novo assembly of Nanopore and Illumina reads. In addition to traditional microbial taxonomic approaches, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis was performed to classify the phylogenetic lineage. Agar diffusion discs assay was performed to test antibiotics susceptibility. The draft genomes after assembly and scaffolding were annotated with the Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology and RNAmmer servers for downstream analysis. ResultsMolecular phylogeny and whole genome analysis of the ISS strains with all publicly available Enterobacter genomes revealed that ISS strains were E. bugandensis and similar to the type strain EB-247T and two clinical isolates (153_ECLO and MBRL 1077). Comparative genomic analyses of all eight E. bungandensis strains showed, a total of 4733 genes were associated with carbohydrate metabolism (635 genes), amino acid and derivatives (496 genes), protein metabolism (291 genes), cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments (275 genes), membrane transport (247 genes), and RNA metabolism (239 genes). In addition, 112 genes identified in the ISS strains were involved in virulence, disease, and defense. Genes associated with resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, including the MDR tripartite system were also identified in the ISS strains. A multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) locus or MAR operon encoding MarA, MarB, MarC, and MarR, which regulate more than 60 genes, including upregulation of drug efflux systems that have been reported in Escherichia coli K12, was also observed in the ISS strains. ConclusionGiven the MDR results for these ISS Enterobacter genomes and increased chance of pathogenicity (PathogenFinder algorithm with > 79% probability), these species pose important health considerations for future missions. Thorough genomic characterization of the strains isolated from ISS can help to understand the pathogenic potential, and inform future missions, but analyzing them in in-vivo systems is required to discern the influence of microgravity on their pathogenicity. Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12866-018-1325-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",
        "Conclusion": "The genomic characterizations showed that the ISS Enterobacter strains might potentially exhibit pathogenicity to human. However, the pathogenicity of the ISS strains compared to clinical strains isolated from patients should be explored in vivo experiments before making any assumption about whether these potential AMR gene markers are due to spaceflight changes or not. Moreover, the transit time and route for the organisms from the ISS may have some small impact on the response or physiological traits of the bacteria. WGS is still an important tool to monitor transmission routes of opportunistic pathogen bacteria [25, 26]. To avoid this, future missions could utilize Nanopore sequencing directly in microgravity as well as additional function and taxonomic classification methods [26, 54], and then leverage the above detailed analytic steps to gauge relevance for crew health and safety.",

The investigation included the A. nidulans wild-type and 3 mutant strains, two of which were genetically engineered to enhance secondary metabolite production. Whole genome sequencing revealed that ISS conditions altered the A. nidulans genome in specific regions. In strain CW12001, which features overexpression of the secondary metabolite global regulator laeA, ISS conditions induced the loss of the laeA stop codon. Differential expression of proteins involved in stress response, carbohydrate metabolic processes, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis was also observed. ISS conditions significantly decreased prenyl xanthone production in the wild-type strain and increased asperthecin production in LO1362 and CW12001, which are deficient in a major DNA repair mechanism. These data provide valuable insights into the adaptation mechanism of A. nidulans to spacecraft environments.",

The low-nutrient environment combined with enhanced irradiation and microgravity may trigger changes in the molecular suite of microorganisms leading to increased virulence and resistance of microbes. Proteomic characterization of two Aspergillus fumigatus strains, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, isolated from HEPA filter debris and cupola surface of the ISS, respectively, is presented, along with a comparison to experimentally established clinical isolates Af293 and CEA10. In-depth analysis highlights variations in the proteome of both ISS-isolated strains when compared to the clinical strains. Proteins that showed increased abundance in ISS isolates were overall involved in stress responses, and carbohydrate and secondary metabolism. Among the most abundant proteins were Pst2 and ArtA involved in oxidative stress response, PdcA and AcuE responsible for ethanol fermentation and glyoxylate cycle, respectively, TpcA, TpcF, and TpcK that are part of trypacidin biosynthetic pathway, and a toxin Asp-hemolysin.

        "Abstract": "BackgroundThe International Space Station (ISS) is a closed system inhabited by microorganisms originating from life support systems, cargo, and crew that are exposed to unique selective pressures such as microgravity. To date, mandatory microbial monitoring and observational studies of spacecraft and space stations have been conducted by traditional culture methods, although it is known that many microbes cannot be cultured with standard techniques. To fully appreciate the true number and diversity of microbes that survive in the ISS, molecular and culture-based methods were used to assess microbial communities on ISS surfaces. Samples were taken at eight pre-defined locations during three flight missions spanning 14 months and analyzed upon return to Earth. ResultsThe cultivable bacterial and fungal population ranged from 104 to 109 CFU/m2 depending on location and consisted of various bacterial (Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria) and fungal (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota) phyla. Amplicon sequencing detected more bacterial phyla when compared to the culture-based analyses, but both methods identified similar numbers of fungal phyla. Changes in bacterial and fungal load (by culture and qPCR) were observed over time but not across locations. Bacterial community composition changed over time, but not across locations, while fungal community remained the same between samplings and locations. There were no significant differences in community composition and richness after propidium monoazide sample treatment, suggesting that the analyzed DNA was extracted from intact/viable organisms. Moreover, approximately 46% of intact/viable bacteria and 40% of intact/viable fungi could be cultured. ConclusionsThe results reveal a diverse population of bacteria and fungi on ISS environmental surfaces that changed over time but remained similar between locations. The dominant organisms are associated with the human microbiome and may include opportunistic pathogens. This study provides the first comprehensive catalog of both total and intact/viable bacteria and fungi found on surfaces in closed space systems and can be used to help develop safety measures that meet NASA requirements for deep space human habitation. The results of this study can have significant impact on our understanding of other confined built environments on the Earth such as clean rooms used in the pharmaceutical and medical industries.

        "Abstract": "Filamentous fungi have been associated with extreme habitats, including nuclear power plant accident sites and the International Space Station (ISS). Due to their immense adaptation and phenotypic plasticity capacities, fungi may thrive in what seems like uninhabitable niches. This study is the first report of fungal survival after exposure of monolayers of conidia to simulated Mars conditions (SMC). Conidia of several Chernobyl nuclear accident-associated and ISS-isolated strains were tested for UV-C and SMC sensitivity, which resulted in strain-dependent survival. Strains surviving exposure to SMC for 30 min, ISSFT-021-30 and IMV 00236-30, were further characterized for proteomic, and metabolomic changes. Differential expression of proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, translation, and carbohydrate metabolic processes was observed. No significant metabolome alterations were revealed. Lastly, ISSFT-021-30 conidia re-exposed to UV-C exhibited enhanced UV-C resistance when compared to the conidia of unexposed ISSFT-021.",

The existing methods for discovery of RiPPs by combining genome mining and computational mass spectrometry are limited to discovering specific classes of RiPPs from small datasets, and they fail to handle unknown post-translational modifications. We present MetaMiner, a software tool for addressing these challenges that is compatible with large-scale screening platforms for natural product discovery. After searching millions of spectra in the Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) molecular networking infrastructure against just eight genomic and metagenomic datasets, MetaMiner discovered 31 known and seven unknown RiPPs from diverse microbial communities including human microbiome, lichen microbiome, and micro-organisms isolated from the International Space Station.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundWith increasing numbers of interplanetary missions, there is a need to establish robust protocols to ensure the protection of extraterrestrial planets being visited from contamination by terrestrial life forms. The current study is the first report comparing the commercial resupply vehicle (CRV) microbiome with the International Space Station (ISS) microbiome to understand the risks of contamination, thus serving as a model system for future planetary missions. ResultsSamples obtained from the internal surfaces and ground support equipment of three CRV missions were subjected to various molecular techniques for microbial diversity analysis. In total, 25 samples were collected with eight defined locations from each CRV mission prior to launch. In general, the internal surfaces of vehicles were clean, with an order of magnitude fewer microbes compared to ground support equipment. The first CRV mission had a larger microbial population than subsequent CRV missions, which were clean as compared to the initial CRV locations sampled. Cultivation assays showed the presence of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes and members of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. As expected, shotgun metagenome analyses revealed the presence of more microbial taxa compared to cultivation-based assays. The internal locations of the CRV microbiome reportedly showed the presence of microorganisms capable of tolerating ultraviolet radiation (e.g., Bacillus firmus) and clustered separately from the ISS microbiome. ConclusionsThe metagenome sequence comparison of the CRV microbiome with the ISS microbiome revealed significant differences showing that CRV microbiomes were a negligible part of the ISS environmental microbiome. These findings suggest that the maintenance protocols in cleaning CRV surfaces are highly effective in controlling the contaminating microbial population during cargo transfer to the ISS via the CRV route.",

        "Abstract": "Four strains belonging to the family of Methylobacteriaceae were isolated from different locations on the International Space Station (ISS) across two consecutive flights. Of these, three were identified as Gram-negative, rod-shaped, catalase-positive, oxidase-positive, motile bacteria, designated as IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, whereas the fourth was identified as Methylorubrum rhodesianum. The sequence similarity of these three ISS strains, designated as IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, was <99.4% for 16S rRNA genes and <97.3% for gyrB gene, with the closest being Methylobacterium indicum SE2.11T. Furthermore, the multi-locus sequence analysis placed these three ISS strains in the same clade of M. indicum. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) values of these three ISS strains were <93% and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values were <46.4% with any described Methylobacterium species. Based on the ANI and dDDH analyses, these three ISS strains were considered as novel species belonging to the genus Methylobacterium. The three ISS strains showed 100% ANI similarity and dDDH values with each other, indicating that these three ISS strains, isolated during various flights and from different locations, belong to the same species. These three ISS strains were found to grow optimally at temperatures from 25 to 30\u00b0C, pH 6.0 to 8.0, and NaCl 0 to 1%. Phenotypically, these three ISS strains resemble M. aquaticum and M. terrae since they assimilate similar sugars as sole carbon substrate when compared to other Methylobacterium species. Fatty acid analysis showed that the major fatty acid produced by the ISS strains are C18:1\u2212\u03c97c and C18:1\u2212\u03c96c. The predominant quinone was ubiquinone 10, and the major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and an unidentified lipid. Therefore, based on genomic, phylogenetic, biochemical, and fatty acid analyses, strains IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, are assigned to a novel species within the genus Methylobacterium, and the name Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is IF7SW-B2T (NRRL B-65601T and LMG 32165T).",

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Most natural populations are genetically diverse. Understanding how diversity is maintained and distributed across time and space can provide insights into the potential for evolution and extinction of populations. Immunogenetic diversity aids individuals and populations in resisting infectious disease, with many studies linking resistance to genes encoding adaptive immune responses, such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. The MHC is particularly important for advancing our understanding of local adaptive processes and host\u2013parasite interactions. Here, we review the emerging work and theory exploring the geographic and temporal patterns of MHC diversity in the wild and how they are shaped by selective and demographic processes. We discuss patterns of variation along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients and place this in the context of Latitude Diversity Gradient and Central Marginal Theories. We emphasize how MHC diversity is often lower at the edges of species distributions, particularly in high\u2010latitude and high\u2010altitude regions. We also discuss MHC diversity in natural populations facing climate change. As climate change accelerates and emerging parasites spread, reduced immunogenetic diversity could severely threaten wildlife populations, compromising their resilience and long\u2010term survival. We propose that including immunogenetic diversity into a larger database of environmental and parasite data would allow biologists to test hypotheses regarding host\u2013parasite coevolution and develop effective measures for conservation.",
        "Conclusion": "5  Investigating mechanisms that maintain genetic diversity will advance our understanding of local adaptive processes, particularly from infectious diseases. Ongoing research of parasite\u2010driven selective processes under natural conditions should focus on characterizing MHC genetic variation at complete class I and II loci from well\u2010assembled and well\u2010annotated genomes and transcriptomes. In addition, changes in adaptive versus neutral marker allele frequencies over time should contribute to understanding the relative contribution of drift, selection, and parasite\u2010mediated selection mechanisms in shaping patterns of functional diversity. To estimate allele frequencies by using candidate and neutral markers, we must consider broad spatial and temporal scales across vertebrates as a whole. Furthermore, changes in allele frequency could be significant in habitats susceptible to sudden climatic events or the arrival of new parasites. These advances will only be possible by improving the accessibility of centralized public and multidisciplinary large data sets to increase our integrative knowledge on the importance of adaptive genetic variability in wild animals. Wildlife conservation efforts that monitor MHC genetic diversity across space and time\u2014at the edges of species distributions, in long\u2010term fragmented habitats, or at northern latitudes\u2014will be most effective for ensuring long\u2010term species preservation in the face of climate change and emerging diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Black fungi are a group of melanotic microfungi characterized by remarkable polyextremotolerance. Due to a broad ecological plasticity and adaptations at the cellular level, it is predicted that they may survive in a variety of extreme environments, including harsh niches on Earth and Mars, and in outer space. However, the molecular mechanisms aiding survival, especially in space, are yet to be fully elucidated. Based on these premises, the rock-inhabiting black fungus Knufia chersonesos (Wt) and its non-melanized mutant (Mut) were exposed to simulated microgravity\u2014one of the prevalent features characterizing space conditions\u2014by growing the cultures in high-aspect-ratio vessels (HARVs). Qualitative and quantitative proteomic analyses were performed on the mycelia and supernatant of culture medium (secretome) to assess alterations in cell physiology in response to low-shear simulated microgravity (LSSMG) and to ultimately evaluate the role of cell-wall melanization in stress survival. Differential expression was observed for proteins involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolic processes, transport, and ribosome biogenesis and translation via ribosomal translational machinery. However, no evidence of significant activation of stress components or starvation response was detected, except for the scytalone dehydratase, enzyme involved in the synthesis of dihydroxynaphthalene (DNH) melanin, which was found to be upregulated in the secretome of the wild type and downregulated in the mutant. Differences in protein modulation were observed between K. chersonesos Wt and Mut, with several proteins being downregulated under LSSMG in the Mut when compared to the Wt. Lastly, no major morphological alterations were observed following exposure to LSSMG. Similarly, the strains\u2019 survivability was not negatively affected. This study is the first to characterize the response to simulated microgravity in black fungi, which might have implications on future astrobiological missions.",

The microorganisms that associate with plant tissues play a critical role in improving plant health and production. To that end, we developed a methodology to investigate the transcriptional activities of the microbiome of red romaine lettuce, a key salad crop that was grown under International Space Station (ISS)-like conditions. Microbial transcripts enriched from host\u2013microbe total RNA were sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing platform. Results show that this enrichment approach was highly reproducible and could be an effective approach for the on-site detection of microbial transcriptional activity. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using metatranscriptomics of enriched microbial RNA as a potential method for on-site monitoring of the transcriptional activity of crop microbiomes, thereby helping to facilitate and maintain plant health for on-orbit space food production.",

        "Abstract": "Space flight has many adverse effects on the physiological functions of astronauts. Certain similarities have been observed in some physiological processes of rodents and astronauts in space, although there are also differences. These similarities make rodents helpful models for initial investigations into space-induced physiological changes. This study uses a 3D-Clinostat to simulate microgravity and explores the role of microgravity in space flight-induced liver and brain abnormalities by comparing changes in the gut microbiota, serum metabolites, and the function and physiological biochemistry of liver and brain tissues between the simulated microgravity (SMG) group mice and the wild type (WT) group mice. The study, based on hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, 16S sequencing technology, and non-targeted metabolomics analysis, shows that the gut tissue morphology of the SMG group mice is abnormal, and the structure of the gut microbiota and the serum metabolite profile are imbalanced. Furthermore, using PICRUST 2 technology, we have predicted the functions of the gut microbiota and serum metabolites, and the results indicate that the liver metabolism and functions (including lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and sugar metabolism, etc.) of the SMG group mice are disrupted, and the brain tissue metabolism and functions (including neurotransmitters and hormone secretion, etc.) are abnormal, suggesting a close relationship between microgravity and liver metabolic dysfunction and brain dysfunction. Additionally, the high similarity in the structure of the gut microbiota and serum metabolite profile between the fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) group mice and the SMG group mice, and the physiological and biochemical differences in liver and brain tissues compared to the WT group mice, suggest that microgravity induces imbalances in the gut microbiota, which in turn triggers abnormalities in liver and brain metabolism and function. Finally, through MetaMapp analysis and Pearson correlation analysis, we found that valeric acid, a metabolite of gut microbiota, is more likely to be the key metabolite that relates to microgravity-induced gut microbiota abnormalities, disorders of amino acid and lipid metabolism, and further induced metabolic or functional disorders in the liver and brain. This study has significant practical application value for deepening the understanding of the adaptability of living organisms in the space environment.",

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT In an ongoing microbial tracking investigation of the International Space Station (ISS), several Sphingomonas strains were isolated. Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence, phylogenetic analysis identified the ISS strains as Sphingomonas sanguinis (n = 2) and one strain isolated from the Kennedy Space Center cleanroom (used to assemble various Mars mission spacecraft components) as Sphingomonas paucimobilis. Metagenomic sequence analyses of different ISS locations identified 23 Sphingomonas species. An abundance of shotgun metagenomic reads were detected for S. sanguinis in the location from where the ISS strains were isolated. A complete metagenome-assembled genome was generated from the shotgun reads metagenome, and its comparison with the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of the ISS S. sanguinis isolates revealed that they were highly similar. In addition to the phylogeny, the WGS of these Sphingomonas strains were compared with the WGS of the type strains to elucidate genes that can potentially aid in plant growth promotion. Furthermore, the WGS comparison of these strains with the well-characterized Sphingomonas sp. LK11, an arid desert strain, identified several genes responsible for the production of phytohormones and for stress tolerance. Production of one of the phytohormones, indole-3-acetic acid, was further confirmed in the ISS strains using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Pathways associated with phosphate uptake, metabolism, and solubilization in soil were conserved across all the S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis strains tested. Furthermore, genes thought to promote plant resistance to abiotic stress, including heat/cold shock response, heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance, appear to be present in these space-related S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis strains. Characterizing these biotechnologically important microorganisms found on the ISS and harnessing their key features will aid in the development of self-sustainable long-term space missions in the future. IMPORTANCE Sphingomonas is ubiquitous in nature, including the anthropogenically contaminated extreme environments. Members of the Sphingomonas genus have been identified as potential candidates for space biomining beyond earth. This study describes the isolation and identification of Sphingomonas members from the ISS, which are capable of producing the phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid. Microbial production of phytohormones will help future in situ studies, grow plants beyond low earth orbit, and establish self-sustainable life support systems. Beyond phytohormone production, stable genomic elements of abiotic stress resistance, heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance were identified, rendering the ISS Sphingomonas isolate a strong candidate for biotechnology-related applications.",
        "Conclusion": "This study utilized comparative genomics and identified a plethora of factors in Sphingomonas present in spaceflight environments that may result in the production of several PGPFs and aid in the growth of plants. The production of one of the phytohormones IAA was also confirmed using metabolomics. These space Sphingomonas strains, along with other plant growth-promoting strains of microbes isolated from the ISS (62), therefore, hold great potential to contribute to space exploration through promoting and controlling plant growth as part of an integrated bio-regenerative life support system enabling future extended-duration crewed missions.",

        "Abstract": "Multiple strains of a novel yeast belonging to genus Naganishia were isolated from environmental surfaces aboard the International Space Station (ISS). These strains exhibited a phenotype similar to Titan cell (~10 \u00b5m diameter) morphology when grown under a combination of simulated microgravity and 5% CO2 conditions. Confocal, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy revealed distinct morphological differences between the microgravity-grown cells and the standard Earth gravity-grown cells, including larger cells and thicker cell walls, altered intracellular morphology, modifications to extracellular fimbriae, budding, and the shedding of bud scars. Phylogenetic analyses via multi-locus sequence typing indicated that these ISS strains represented a single species in the genus Naganishia and were clustered with Naganishia diffluens. The name Naganishia tulchinskyi is proposed to accommodate these strains, with IF6SW-B1T as the holotype. The gene ontologies were assigned to the cell morphogenesis, microtubule-based response, and response to UV light, suggesting a variety of phenotypes that are well suited to respond to microgravity and radiation. Genomic analyses also indicated that the extracellular region, outer membrane, and cell wall were among the highest cellular component results, thus implying a set of genes associated with Titan-like cell plasticity. Finally, the highest molecular function matches included cytoskeletal motor activity, microtubule motor activity, and nuclear export signal receptor activity.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundRecent studies have provided insights into the persistence and succession of microbes aboard the International Space Station (ISS), notably the dominance of Klebsiella pneumoniae. However, the interactions between the various microbes aboard the ISS and how they shape the microbiome remain to be clearly understood. In this study, we apply a computational approach to predict possible metabolic interactions in the ISS microbiome and shed further light on its organization. ResultsThrough a combination of a systems-based graph-theoretical approach, and a constraint-based community metabolic modeling approach, we demonstrated several key interactions in the ISS microbiome. These complementary approaches provided insights into the metabolic interactions and dependencies present amongst various microbes in a community, highlighting key interactions and keystone species. Our results showed that the presence of K. pneumoniae is beneficial to many other microorganisms it coexists with, notably those from the Pantoea genus. Species belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family were often found to be the most beneficial for the survival of other microorganisms in the ISS microbiome. However, K. pneumoniae was found to exhibit parasitic and amensalistic interactions with Aspergillus and Penicillium species, respectively. To prove this metabolic prediction, K. pneumoniae and Aspergillus fumigatus were co-cultured under normal and simulated microgravity, where K. pneumoniae cells showed parasitic characteristics to the fungus. The electron micrography revealed that the presence of K. pneumoniae compromised the morphology of fungal conidia and degenerated its biofilm-forming structures. ConclusionOur study underscores the importance of K. pneumoniae in the ISS, and its potential positive and negative interactions with other microbes, including potential pathogens. This integrated modeling approach, combined with experiments, demonstrates the potential for understanding the organization of other such microbiomes, unravelling key organisms and their interdependencies. Video Abstract Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40168-022-01279-y.",
        "Conclusion": "In summary, our analyses show the key role played by Klebsiella and other Enterobacteriaceae in mediating the metabolic interactions taking place between microorganisms in the ISS. Metabolic modeling, through a combination of graph-theoretic approaches and steady-state constraint-based modeling, paints a more comprehensive picture of possible microbial interactions, which are as yet inscrutable to this extent by experimental approaches. Our results point towards key dependencies of microorganisms in various locations on the ISS and can pave the way for possible interventions that may rely on targeted disinfection of surfaces aboard the ISS. Our approach also underscores the importance of complementary modeling approaches in dissecting a fairly complex microbiome and understanding various possible interactions. Our methodology is fairly generic and can be readily extended to predict microbial interactions in other interesting milieu and generate testable hypotheses for wet lab experiments, as we have demonstrated in this study with Klebsiella and Aspergillus species.",

        "Abstract": "The use of film media involves considerably less preparation, waste, and incubator space than conventional agar-media-based assays and has proven in past studies to provide counts of cultivable microbes similar to those of traditional agar media. Film media also have the advantage of allowing sample volumes similar to those used in pour plates and, therefore, are well-suited for cultivable microbial counts in extremely low-biomass environments such as clean rooms or space habitats, particularly where the subsequent isolation of colonies is necessary. As the preparation of film media plates relies on water cohesion/adhesion rather than manual spreading, they may have future applications in low- or microgravity settings. In this study, cultivable microbial count performance was compared between agar media and film media in three kinds of samples: food items, surfaces in built environments on Earth (homes), and on the environmental surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS). Easy Plates (Kikkoman Corporation) and Petrifilm (3M) were compared with traditional agar plating for food and home surfaces, while only Easy Plates were compared with agar for ISS samples. For both food items and built environments on Earth, both types of film media performed comparably to agar media for bacterial counts, with R2 values of 0.94\u20130.96. Fungal counts for built-environment samples had a lower correlation between film and agar counts, with R2 values of 0.72\u20130.73. Samples from the ISS, which ranged from below detection to 103 CFU per 100 cm2, had R2 values of 0.80 for bacterial counts and 0.73 for fungal counts, partially due to multiple samples recording below the detection limit for agar or too numerous to count, and the growth of fungal species on R2A medium. The species compositions of isolates picked from agar vs. film media plates were similar; however, further phylogenetic analysis is needed to confirm the differential microbial diversity composition. Overall, film media such as Easy Plates and Petrifilm are viable alternatives to agar plates for low-biomass built environments as well as for food samples, and the two brands tested in this study performed equally well.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundMonitoring the adaptation of microorganisms to the extreme environment of the International Space Station (ISS) is crucial to understanding microbial evolution and infection prevention. Acinetobacter pittii is an opportunistic nosocomial pathogen, primarily impacting immunocompromised patients, that was recently isolated from two missions aboard the ISS. ResultsHere, we report how ISS-associated A. pittii (n = 20 genomes) has formed its own genetically and functionally discrete clade distinct from most Earth-bound isolates (n = 291 genomes). The antimicrobial susceptibility testing of ISS strains and two related clinical isolates demonstrated that ISS strains acquired more resistance, specifically with regard to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, despite no prediction of increased resistance based on genomic analysis of resistance genes. By investigating 402 longitudinal environmental and host-associated ISS metagenomes, we observed that viable A. pittii is increasing in relative abundance and therefore potentially exhibiting succession, being identified in >2X more metagenomic samples in back-to-back missions. ISS strains additionally contain functions that enable them to survive in harsh environments, including the transcriptional regulator LexA. Via a genome-wide association study, we identified a high level of mutational burden in methionine sulfoxide reductase genes relative to the most closely related Earth strains. ConclusionsOverall, these results indicated a step forward in understanding how microorganisms might evolve and alter their antibiotic resistance phenotype in extreme, resource-limited, human-built environments.

        "Conclusion": "A microbe\u2019s ability to grow and survive in variable conditions is defined by its ability to respond to various environmental demands under suboptimal conditions. The advantage of microbes, having a short generation time, is that their mutational frequency allows for great genetic diversity. Here, we describe the \u201cISS effect,\u201d where microbes may adapt to the extreme environment of the ISS through mechanisms that enhance their survival and may contribute to augmented antimicrobial resistance (despite not being exposed to antimicrobials). We show the potential ecological succession of A. pittii aboard the ISS as well as the longitudinal effects of the ISS effect via increased mutational frequencies and acquisition of further stress-associated protein-coding genes. We additionally identify particular, highly variable, sequences of interest (i.e., MSR enzymes) that are worth further investigation as spaceflight-impacted genes. Overall, we found that the extreme environment of the ISS is possibly exacting an intense selective pressure on A. pittii, and the nature of the genomic changes warrant continued observation in the years to come.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundSeveral investigations on the microbial diversity and functional properties of the International Space Station (ISS) environment were carried out to understand the influence of spaceflight conditions on the microbial population. However, metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of ISS samples are yet to be generated and subjected to various genomic analyses, including phylogenetic affiliation, predicted functional pathways, antimicrobial resistance, and virulence characteristics. ResultsIn total, 46 MAGs were assembled from 21 ISS environmental metagenomes, in which metaSPAdes yielded 20 MAGs and metaWRAP generated 26 MAGs. Among 46 MAGs retrieved, 18 bacterial species were identified, including one novel genus/species combination (Kalamiella piersonii) and one novel bacterial species (Methylobacterium ajmalii). In addition, four bins exhibited fungal genomes; this is the first-time fungal genomes were assembled from ISS metagenomes. Phylogenetic analyses of five bacterial species showed ISS-specific evolution. The genes pertaining to cell membranes, such as transmembrane transport, cell wall organization, and regulation of cell shape, were enriched. Variations in the antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) and virulence genes of the selected 20 MAGs were characterized to predict the ecology and evolution of biosafety level (BSL) 2 microorganisms in space. Since microbial virulence increases in microgravity, AMR gene sequences of MAGs were compared with genomes of respective ISS isolates and corresponding type strains. Among these 20 MAGs characterized, AMR genes were more prevalent in the Enterobacter bugandensis MAG, which has been predominantly isolated from clinical samples. MAGs were further used to analyze if genes involved in AMR and biofilm formation of viable microbes in ISS have variation due to generational evolution in microgravity and radiation pressure. ConclusionsComparative analyses of MAGs and whole-genome sequences of related ISS isolates and their type strains were characterized to understand the variation related to the microbial evolution under microgravity. The Pantoea/Kalamiella strains have the maximum single-nucleotide polymorphisms found within the ISS strains examined. This may suggest that Pantoea/Kalamiella strains are much more subjective to microgravity changes. The reconstructed genomes will enable researchers to study the evolution of genomes under microgravity and low-dose irradiation compared to the evolution of microbes here on Earth. Video Abstract Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40168-023-01545-7.",
        "Conclusion": "In summary, good quality bacterial and fungal MAGs were generated from ISS environmental samples, and functional properties were predicted. Furthermore, it was possible to describe novel microbial (two bacterial and one yeast) species via the \u201cmetagenome to phenome\u201d approach. The monophyletic phylogeny exhibited by the ISS genomes (both isolates and MAGs) suggested that they shared a single common ancestor. The molecules pertaining to the cell membranes, such as transmembrane transport, cell wall organization, and regulation of cell shape, were in high frequency in ISS genomes demonstrating evidence for ISS-specific bacterial evolution. The common gene-based resistance phenomenon noticed in this study suggests that SNP changes in MAGs and ISS genomes might be an adaptation strategy in AMR and biofilm formation in microbes. Similarly, variations found in the AMR and virulence genes enabled the prediction of the ecology and evolution of microorganisms in space. The maximum SNPs characterized for the ISS Pantoea/Kalamiella strains suggested that enterobacterial species are much more subjective to microgravity changes. However, fixation of environmental samples in space for RNAseq approach and/or in situ sequencing in space are warranted to confirm variation related to microbial evolution under microgravity. More studies are needed to unearth whether SNPs seen in ISS MAGs are due to generational evolution in microgravity and radiation pressure.",

        "Abstract": "A single strain from the family Paenibacillaceae was isolated from the wall behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in April 2018, as part of the Microbial Tracking mission series. This strain was identified as a gram-positive, rod-shaped, oxidase-positive, catalase-negative motile bacterium in the genus Cohnella, designated as F6_2S_P_1T. The 16S sequence of the F6_2S_P_1T strain places it in a clade with C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli, which were originally isolated from plant tissue or rhizosphere environments. The closest 16S and gyrB matches to strain F6_2S_P_1T are to C. rhizosphaerae with 98.84 and 93.99% sequence similarity, while a core single-copy gene phylogeny from all publicly available Cohnella genomes places it as more closely related to C. ginsengisoli. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA\u2013DNA hybridization (dDDH) values to any described Cohnella species are <89 and <22%, respectively. The major fatty acids for strain F6_2S_P_1T are anteiso-C15:0 (51.7%), iso-C16:0 (23.1%), and iso-C15:0 (10.5%), and it is able to metabolize a wide range of carbon compounds. Given the results of the ANI and dDDH analyses, this ISS strain is a novel species within the genus Cohnella for which we propose the name Cohnella hashimotonis, with the type strain F6_2S_P_1T (=NRRL B-65657T and DSMZ 115098T). Because no closely related Cohnella genomes were available, this study generated the whole-genome sequences (WGSs) of the type strains for C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli. Phylogenetic and pangenomic analysis reveals that F6_2S_P_1T, C. rhizosphaerae, and C. ginsengisoli, along with two uncharacterized Cohnella strains, possess a shared set of 332 gene clusters which are not shared with any other WGS of Cohnella species, and form a distinct clade branching off from C. nanjingensis. Functional traits were predicted for the genomes of strain F6_2S_P_1T and other members of this clade.",
        "Conclusion": "We used multiple means of characterization, including phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional genome-prediction methods to characterize Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T and place it within the established taxonomy of the genus Cohnella. Based on these data, we propose that this novel species be named C. hashimotonis. We also characterized the branch of Cohnella within which C. hashimotonis is placed and predicted functional characteristics of C. hashimotonis and the C. ginsengisoli clade as a whole. All species of Cohnella closely related to C. hashimotonis are from the plant/rhizosphere environment and likely have mutualistic associations with plant roots or other tissue. It is likely, therefore, that C. hashimotonis was introduced to the ISS not as a human commensal but as a plant commensal during one of the many plant growth experiments conducted on board. Nevertheless, C. hashimotonis can clearly survive in the extreme conditions of the ISS built environment, including radiation exposure, desiccation, low nutrient availability, and microgravity, and is closely related to a number of rhizosphere bacteria; it is therefore a promising candidate for testing as a member of plant-growth-promoting consortia for future plant experiments in outer space.",

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Klebsiella species, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella aerogenes, and Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, are opportunistic pathogens that commonly cause infections in humans. Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKP) is a subgroup of K. pneumoniae, which has gained attention due to its global dissemination, its capacity to cause invasive infections in community settings among immunocompetent individuals, and its escalating antibiotic resistance levels. Our study presents the first comprehensive phenotypic and genotypic analysis including mobile genetic elements (MGEs) of Klebsiella isolates from the International Space Station (ISS). The genomes of K. pneumoniae, K. aerogenes, and K. quasipneumoniae offered insights into their antimicrobial resistance, virulence, thermotolerance, disinfectant resistance, and MGEs. All isolates were part of emerging pathogenic lineages with K. quasipneumoniae ST138 presenting spatial and temporal persistence aboard the ISS, possibly due to its genotypic profile encoding for numerous resistance genes to disinfectants and heavy metals. We also report on the isolation of a yersiniabactin-encoding K. pneumoniae, belonging to the emerging high-risk ST101 clone, aboard the ISS. A potential dissemination of hvKp strains on ISS might pose a risk to the immunocompromised crew members. Moreover, MGEs containing virulent loci could enable horizontal gene transfer to other benign microorganisms on the ISS, possibly enhancing their virulence potential. Additionally, some Klebsiella genomes exhibited genetic divergence from their respective lineages, which we hypothesize results from the unique spaceflight associated environmental pressures. These findings underscore the need to monitor microbial communities in space to comprehend their survival mechanisms and implications for human health. IMPORTANCEThe International Space Station (ISS) is a unique, hermetically sealed environment, subject to environmental pressures not encountered on Earth, including microgravity and radiation (cosmic ionising/UV). While bacteria's adaptability during spaceflight remains elusive, recent research suggests that it may be species and even clone-specific. Considering the documented spaceflight-induced suppression of the human immune system, a deper understanding of the genomics of potential human pathogens in space could shed light on species and lineages of medical astromicrobiological significance. In this study, we used hybrid assembly methods and comparative genomics to deliver a comprehensive genomic characterization of 10 Klebsiella isolates retrieved from the ISS. Our analysis unveiled that Klebsiella quasipneumoniae ST138 demonstrates both spatial and temporal persistence aboard the ISS, showing evidence of genomic divergence from its Earth-based ST138 lineage. Moreover, we characterized plasmids from Klebsiella species of ISS origin, which harbored genes for disinfectant resistance and enhanced thermotolerance, suggestin possible adaptive advantages. Furthermore, we identified a mobile genetic element containing a hypervirulence-associated locus belonging to a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate of the \u201chigh-risk\u201d ST101 clone. Our work provides insights into the adaptability and persistence of Klebsiella species during spaceflight, highlighting the importance of understanding the dynamics of potential pathogenic bacteria in such environments.",

        "Abstract": "With the advent of long-term human habitation in space and on the moon, understanding how the built environment microbiome of space habitats differs from Earth habitats, and how microbes survive, proliferate and spread in space conditions, is becoming more important. The microbial tracking mission series has been monitoring the microbiome of the International Space Station (ISS) for almost a decade. During this mission series, six unique strains of Gram-stain-positive bacteria, including two spore-forming and three non-spore-forming species, were isolated from the environmental surfaces of the ISS. The analysis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed > 99% similarities with previously described bacterial species. To further explore their phylogenetic affiliation, whole genome sequencing was undertaken. For all strains, the gyrB gene exhibited < 93% similarity with closely related species, which proved effective in categorizing these ISS strains as novel species. Average nucleotide identity and digital DNA\u2013DNA hybridization values, when compared to any known bacterial species, were < 94% and <50% respectively for all species described here. Traditional biochemical tests, fatty acid profiling, polar lipid, and cell wall composition analyses were performed to generate phenotypic characterization of these ISS strains. A study of the shotgun metagenomic reads from the ISS samples, from which the novel species were isolated, showed that only 0.1% of the total reads mapped to the novel species, supporting the idea that these novel species are rare in the ISS environments. In-depth annotation of the genomes unveiled a variety of genes linked to amino acid and derivative synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments, and protein metabolism. Further analysis of these ISS-isolated organisms revealed that, on average, they contain 46 genes associated with virulence, disease, and defense. The main predicted functions of these genes are: conferring resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, and enabling invasion and intracellular resistance. After conducting antiSMASH analysis, it was found that there are roughly 16 cluster types across the six strains, including \u03b2-lactone and type III polyketide synthase (T3PKS) clusters. Based on these multi-faceted taxonomic methods, it was concluded that these six ISS strains represent five novel species, which we propose to name as follows: Arthrobacter burdickii IIF3SC-B10T (= NRRL B-65660T = DSM 115933T), Leifsonia virtsii F6_8S_P_1AT (= NRRL B-65661T = DSM 115931T), Leifsonia williamsii F6_8S_P_1BT (= NRRL B-65662T = DSM 115932T), Paenibacillus vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT (= NRRL B-65663T = DSM 115940T), and Sporosarcina highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T (= NRRL B-65664T = DSM 115943T). Identifying and characterizing the genomes and phenotypes of novel microbes found in space habitats, like those explored in this study, is integral for expanding our genomic databases of space-relevant microbes. This approach offers the only reliable method to determine species composition, track microbial dispersion, and anticipate potential threats to human health from monitoring microbes on the surfaces and equipment within space habitats. By unraveling these microbial mysteries, we take a crucial step towards ensuring the safety and success of future space missions.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundThe International Space Station (ISS) stands as a testament to human achievement in space exploration. Despite its highly controlled environment, characterised by microgravity, increased CO2 levels, and elevated solar radiation, microorganisms occupy a unique niche. These microbial inhabitants play a significant role in influencing the health and well-being of astronauts on board. One microorganism of particular interest in our study is Enterobacter bugandensis, primarily found in clinical specimens including the human gastrointestinal tract, and also reported to possess pathogenic traits, leading to a plethora of infections. ResultsDistinct from their Earth counterparts, ISS E. bugandensis strains have exhibited resistance mechanisms that categorise them within the ESKAPE pathogen group, a collection of pathogens recognised for their formidable resistance to antimicrobial treatments. During the 2-year Microbial Tracking 1 mission, 13 strains of multidrug-resistant E. bugandensis were isolated from various locations within the ISS. We have carried out a comprehensive study to understand the genomic intricacies of ISS-derived E. bugandensis in comparison to terrestrial strains, with a keen focus on those associated with clinical infections. We unravel the evolutionary trajectories of pivotal genes, especially those contributing to functional adaptations and potential antimicrobial resistance. A hypothesis central to our study was that the singular nature of the stresses of the space environment, distinct from any on Earth, could be driving these genomic adaptations. Extending our investigation, we meticulously mapped the prevalence and distribution of E. bugandensis across the ISS over time. This temporal analysis provided insights into the persistence, succession, and potential patterns of colonisation of E. bugandensis in space. Furthermore, by leveraging advanced analytical techniques, including metabolic modelling, we delved into the coexisting microbial communities alongside E. bugandensis in the ISS across multiple missions and spatial locations. This exploration revealed intricate microbial interactions, offering a window into the microbial ecosystem dynamics within the ISS. ConclusionsOur comprehensive analysis illuminated not only the ways these interactions sculpt microbial diversity but also the factors that might contribute to the potential dominance and succession of E. bugandensis within the ISS environment. The implications of these findings are twofold. Firstly, they shed light on microbial behaviour, adaptation, and evolution in extreme, isolated environments. Secondly, they underscore the need for robust preventive measures, ensuring the health and safety of astronauts by mitigating risks associated with potential pathogenic threats.

        "Conclusion": "In this study, we presented a robust and comprehensive methodology to decipher the survival mechanisms of the clinically significant microorganism, E. bugandensis, within the challenging environment of the ISS. Through a synergistic integration of genomics, metagenomics, and metabolic modelling, we unravelled the potential strategies employed by E. bugandensis for adaptation and persistence in the unique ISS ecosystem. Our approach holds promise for broader applications, especially in terrestrial controlled settings such as hospital ICUs and surgical theatres. Ultimately, our findings pave the way for a deeper understanding of microbial dynamics in extreme environments, laying a solid foundation for future hypotheses and expanding the horizons of microbial ecology research.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundThe extreme environment of the International Space Station (ISS) puts selective pressure on microorganisms unintentionally introduced during its 20+ years of service as a low-orbit science platform and human habitat. Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions. ResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool\u2014deepFRI\u2014we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity. ConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.

        "Conclusion": "Our work indicates that chemical diversity in SM biosynthesis can be expanded via multiple dimensions. Prior to our work, the richness of the fungal SM pool was presumed to be determined by the number of SM gene clusters while the clustered genes are associated with the biosynthesis of a distinct type of SM, with some exceptions.12,13,35 In our study, we have shown that A. terreus deploys an additional strategy to enrich its natural product pool. Although the same precursor aspulvinone E (1) is shared in two pathways (the aspulvinone pathway, a typical SM pathway and the melanin pathway, producing a self-protection pigment that might also be involved in the pathogenicity of this fungus), the tissue specific expression of their biosynthetic genes results in the production of the same compound in different fungal tissues and allows it to be modified into two different products that, we assume, confer selective advantages in the specific tissues in which they are produced. The localization of production is possibly regulated by their specific promoters, but it is entirely possible that a more complex regulatory mechanism underlies this phenomenon. This expands our insight into spatial regulation of SMs in fungi.36 More investigation into these promoters might provide a means to the cell-type-directed biosynthesis of SMs or manipulating the location of the expression of some genes responsible for products with interesting biological activities. Finally, our data demonstrate that AbpB prenylates compounds in two pathways revealing that two pathways may share the same tailoring genes. It will be of interest to determine if this characteristic is common to, and specific to, prenyl transferases.",

        "Abstract": "Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is associated with an increased risk of vertebral compression fracture (1\u20135). While bone is typically considered radiation-resistant, fractures frequently occur within the first year of SBRT (6\u201311). Our purpose was to determine if rapid deterioration of bone occurs in vertebrae post-irradiation (IR). Sixteen male rhesus macaques non-human primates (NHPs) were analyzed after total chest irradiation (IR) to a midplane dose of 10 Gy. Ages at IR varied from 45 \u2013 134 mo. Computed tomography (CT) scans were taken 2 mo prior to IR and 2, 4, 6, and 8 mo post-IR for all animals. Bone mineral density (BMD) and cortical thickness (Ct.Th) were calculated longitudinally for thoracic (T)9, lumbar (L)2, and L4 vertebral bodies; gross morphology and histopathology were assessed per vertebra. Greater mortality (related to pulmonary toxicity) was noted in NHPs < 50 mo at time of IR vs NHPs > 50mo (p = 0.03). Animals older than 50 mo at IR lost Ct.Th in T9 by 2 mo post IR (p = 0.0009), which persisted to 8 mo. In contrast, no loss of Ct.Th was observed in vertebrae out-of-field (L2 and L4). Loss of BMD was observed by 4 mo post-IR for T9, and 6 mo post IR for L2 and L4 (p < 0.01). For NHPs younger than 50 mo at IR, both Ct.Th and BMD decreased in T9, L2, and L4 by 2 mo post-IR (p < 0.05). Regions that exhibited the greatest degree of cortical thinning as determined from CT scans also exhibited increased porosity histologically. Rapid loss of Ct.Th was observed after high dose chest IR in NHPs. Younger age at IR was associated with increased pneumonitis related mortality, as well as greater loss of both BMD and Ct.Th at both in-and out-of-field vertebrae. Older NHPs exhibited rapid loss of BMD and Ct.Th from in-field vertebrae, but only loss of BMD in out of field vertebrae. Bone is sensitive to high dose radiation, and rapid loss of bone structure and density could facilitate fractures.",

Knee and Hip Joint Cartilage Damage from Combined Spaceflight Hazards of Low-Dose Radiation Less than 1 Gy and Prolonged Hinlimb Unloading. Radiat. Res. 191, 497\u2013506 (2019). Reduced weight bearing, and to a lesser extent radiation, during spaceflight have been shown as potential hazards to astronaut joint health. These hazards combined effect to the knee and hip joints are not well defined, particularly with low-dose exposure to radiation. In this study, we examined the individual and combined effects of varying low-dose radiation (\u22641 Gy) and reduced weight bearing on the cartilage of the knee and hip joints. C57BL/6J mice (n = 80) were either tail suspended via hindlimb unloading (HLU) or remained full-weight bearing (ground). On day 6, each group was divided and irradiated with 0 Gy (sham), 0.1 Gy, 0.5 Gy or 1.0 Gy (n = 10/group), yielding eight groups: ground-sham; ground-0.1 Gy; ground-0.5 Gy; ground-1.0 Gy; HLU-sham; HLU-0.1 Gy; HLU-0.5 Gy; and HLU-1.0 Gy. On day 30, the hindlimbs, hip cartilage and serum were collected from the mice. Significant differences were identified statistically between treatment groups and the ground-sham control group, but no significant differences were observed between HLU and/or radiation groups. Contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography (micro-CECT) demonstrated decrease in volume and thickness at the weight-bearing femoral-tibial cartilage-cartilage contact point in all treatment groups compared to ground-sham. Lower collagen was observed in all groups compared to ground-sham. Circulating serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (sCOMP), a biomarker for ongoing cartilage degradation, was increased in all of the irradiated groups compared to ground-sham, regardless of unloading. Mass spectrometry of the cartilage lining the femoral head and subsequent Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) identified a decrease in cartilage compositional proteins indicative of osteoarthritis. Our findings demonstrate that both individually and combined, HLU and exposure to spaceflight-relevant radiation doses lead to cartilage degradation of the knee and hip with expression of an arthritic phenotype. Moreover, early administration of low-dose irradiation (0.1, 0.5 or 1.0 Gy) causes an active catabolic response in cartilage 24 days postirradiation. Further research is warranted with a focus on the prevention of cartilage degradation from long-term periods of reduced weight bearing and spaceflight-relevant low doses and qualities of radiation.",

        "Abstract": "Both microgravity and radiation exposure in the spaceflight environment have been identified as hazards to astronaut health and performance. Substantial study has been focused on understanding the biology and risks associated with prolonged exposure to microgravity, and the hazards presented by radiation from galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and solar particle events (SPEs) outside of low earth orbit (LEO). To date, the majority of the ground-based analogues (e.g., rodent or cell culture studies) that investigate the biology of and risks associated with spaceflight hazards will focus on an individual hazard in isolation. However, astronauts will face these challenges simultaneously Combined hazard studies are necessary for understanding the risks astronauts face as they travel outside of LEO, and are also critical for countermeasure development. The focus of this review is to describe biologic and functional outcomes from ground-based analogue models for microgravity and radiation, specifically highlighting the combined effects of radiation and reduced weight-bearing from rodent ground-based tail suspension via hind limb unloading (HLU) and partial weight-bearing (PWB) models, although in vitro and spaceflight results are discussed as appropriate. The review focuses on the skeletal, ocular, central nervous system (CNS), cardiovascular, and stem cells responses.",

        "Abstract": "Reduced knee weight-bearing from prescription or sedentary lifestyles are associated with cartilage degradation; effects on the meniscus are unclear. Rodents exposed to spaceflight or hind limb unloading (HLU) represent unique opportunities to evaluate this question. This study evaluated arthritic changes in the medial knee compartment that bears the highest loads across the knee after actual and simulated spaceflight, and recovery with subsequent full weight-bearing. Cartilage and meniscal degradation in mice were measured via microCT, histology, and proteomics and/or biochemically after: (1) ~ 35 days on the International Space Station (ISS); (2) 13-days aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis; or (3) 30 days of HLU, followed by a 49-day weight-bearing readaptation with/without exercise. Cartilage degradation post-ISS and HLU occurred at similar spatial locations, the tibial-femoral cartilage-cartilage contact point, with meniscal volume decline. Cartilage and meniscal glycosaminoglycan content were decreased in unloaded mice, with elevated catabolic enzymes (e.g., matrix metalloproteinases), and elevated oxidative stress and catabolic molecular pathway responses in menisci. After the 13-day Shuttle flight, meniscal degradation was observed. During readaptation, recovery of cartilage volume and thickness occurred with exercise. Reduced weight-bearing from either spaceflight or HLU induced an arthritic phenotype in cartilage and menisci, and exercise promoted recovery.",

        "Abstract": "Particulate hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) is a human lung carcinogen and a human health concern. The induction of structural chromosome instability is considered to be a driving mechanism of Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis. Homologous recombination repair protects against Cr(VI)-induced chromosome damage, due to its highly accurate repair of Cr(VI)-induced DNA double strand breaks. However, recent studies demonstrate Cr(VI) inhibits homologous recombination repair through the misregulation of RAD51. RAD51 is an essential protein in HR repair that facilitates the search for a homologous sequence. Recent studies show prolonged Cr(VI) exposure prevents proper RAD51 subcellular localization, causing it to accumulate in the cytoplasm. Since nuclear import of RAD51 is crucial to its function, this study investigated the effect of Cr(VI) on the RAD51 nuclear import mediators, RAD51C and BRCA2. We show acute (24 h) Cr(VI) exposure induces the proper localization of RAD51C and BRCA2. In contrast, prolonged (120 h) exposure increased the cytoplasmic localization of both proteins, although RAD51C localization was more severely impaired. These results correlate temporally with the previously reported Cr(VI)-induced RAD51 cytoplasmic accumulation. In addition, we found Cr(VI) does not inhibit interaction between RAD51 and its nuclear import mediators. Altogether, our results suggest prolonged Cr(VI) exposure inhibits the nuclear import of RAD51C, and to a lesser extent, BRCA2, which results in the cytoplasmic accumulation of RAD51. Cr(VI)-induced inhibition of nuclear import may play a key role in its carcinogenic mechanism since the nuclear import of many tumor suppressor proteins and DNA repair proteins is crucial to their function.",

        "Abstract": "In space, living organisms are exposed to multiple stress factors including microgravity and space radiation. For humans, these harmful environmental factors have been known to cause negative health impacts such as bone loss and immune dysfunction. Understanding the mechanisms by which spaceflight impacts human health at the molecular level is critical not only for accurately assessing the risks associated with spaceflight, but also for developing effective countermeasures. Over the years, a number of studies have been conducted under real or simulated space conditions. RNA and protein levels in cellular and animal models have been targeted in order to identify pathways affected by spaceflight. Of the many pathways responsive to the space environment, the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) network appears to commonly be affected across many different cell types under the true or simulated spaceflight conditions. NF-\u03baB is of particular interest, as it is associated with many of the spaceflight-related health consequences. This review intends to summarize the transcriptomics studies that identified NF-\u03baB as a responsive pathway to ground-based simulated microgravity or the true spaceflight condition. These studies were carried out using either human cell or animal models. In addition, the review summarizes the studies that focused specifically on NF-\u03baB pathway in specific cell types or organ tissues as related to the known spaceflight-related health risks including immune dysfunction, bone loss, muscle atrophy, central nerve system (CNS) dysfunction, and risks associated with space radiation. Whether the NF-\u03baB pathway is activated or inhibited in space is dependent on the cell type, but the potential health impact appeared to be always negative. It is argued that more studies on NF-\u03baB should be conducted to fully understand this particular pathway for the benefit of crew health in space.",

        "Abstract": "In space, multiple unique environmental factors, particularly microgravity and space radiation, pose constant threat to the DNA integrity of living organisms. Specifically, space radiation can cause damage to DNA directly, through the interaction of charged particles with the DNA molecules themselves, or indirectly through the production of free radicals. Although organisms have evolved strategies on Earth to confront such damage, space environmental conditions, especially microgravity, can impact DNA repair resulting in accumulation of severe DNA lesions. Ultimately these lesions, namely double strand breaks, chromosome aberrations, micronucleus formation, or mutations, can increase the risk for adverse health effects, such as cancer. How spaceflight factors affect DNA damage and the DNA damage response has been investigated since the early days of the human space program. Over the years, these experiments have been conducted either in space or using ground-based analogs. This review summarizes the evidence for DNA damage induction by space radiation and/or microgravity as well as spaceflight-related impacts on the DNA damage response. The review also discusses the conflicting results from studies aimed at addressing the question of potential synergies between microgravity and radiation with regard to DNA damage and cellular repair processes. We conclude that further experiments need to be performed in the true space environment in order to address this critical question.",
        "Conclusion": "Space environmental factors can cause damage to the DNA, resulting in potential detrimental health consequences. Despite the low dose and dose rate nature of space radiation, there is evidence suggesting that cosmic rays induce DNA damage both in cultured cells and in astronauts\u2019 blood cells. There is also evidence indicating that space environment can generate oxidative DNA damage in vivo. For instance, as mentioned above, 8-OHdG was found in urine of astronauts after flight.38 Ultimately, though the biological outcomes of any spaceflight-induced DNA damage also depend on the cellular capacity for repair. However, results from ground and spaceflight studies concerning microgravity\u2019s effects on the DDR have been conflicting. While many studies have reported increased sensitivity to radiation and decreased DNA repair under simulated microgravity (Table 1), most of the experiments conducted in space have shown no effects of spaceflight on the capacity of the cells to repair the artificially induce DNA damage (Table 2), both within and across model systems. In some cases, studies that examined the same endpoints reached opposing conclusions. Perhaps this stems from the fact that ground analogs for microgravity are known to produce some, but not all of the biological effects observed in the true space environment. Experiments conducted in parallel in space and on the ground are needed to fully justify the use of ground-based microgravity analogs. DNA damage and DDR in space are a complex issue. Although the present review focuses on the interplay of microgravity and space radiation, other environmental factors faced during space travel can also induce DNA damage and influence the DDR. For example, when inhaled, dust particles covering the surface of celestial objects56, 57 or toxic chemicals could lead to ROS production and therefore generate DNA damage. Furthermore, elevated CO2 present in spacecraft58 should be considered as a potential DNA damaging factor.59 In addition, inflammatory markers have been reported in astronauts60 and it is known that inflammatory mediators can directly affect the DNA repair process by either enhancing or repressing DNA repair. In particular, NF-\u03baB, a key regulator involved in the production of inflammatory proteins, may play an important role in DNA damage sensing and its subsequent repair. Specifically, the DDR directly activates NF-\u03baB, interferon regulatory factors, and a number of ligands for activating immune receptors.61 As such, a host of other factors need to be considered and controlled for when conducting and interpreting spaceflight studies. Furthermore, due to the composition and low fluence nature of GCRs, over a period of several months cells in space are most likely hit by several protons before a high-LET heavy ion transverses them. Thus, prior exposure of cells to the background GCRs might affect the repair of DNA damage induced by protons emitted from a large SPE and vice versa. Indeed, suggestions for this come from studies showing that exposure of human primary cells to protons followed by heavy Ti or Fe ions resulted in a yield of transformation that is greater than the sum of the yields when the cells were independently exposed to protons or heavy particles.62, 63 Such synergistic effects were dependent on the sequence and timing between proton and heavy ion irradiation. Similarly, after sequential exposures to protons and Fe ions, human epithelial cells showed the peak of synergistic effects in the induction of chromosome aberrations when the time window between the two exposures was 30 min.46 However, another study showed no synergy between proton and Fe ion exposures regardless of the exposure sequence.64 Experiments with sequential exposure to protons and Fe ions have also been conducted in animals. Dual exposures of C57BL/6 mice to protons and Fe ions resulted in pronounced molecular alterations in comparison with either source of radiation alone, as measured by a substantial increase in the expression of cytokine IL-13, loss of expression of DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1, and reactivation of LINE-1, SINE B1 retrotransposons, and major and minor satellites.65 Finally, exposure of C57BL/6 mice to Fe ions caused an increase in expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle cell actin, collagen type III, the inflammatory cell markers mast cell tryptase, CD2 and CD68, the endothelial glycoprotein thrombomodulin, and cleaved caspase 3.66 However, exposure to protons 24 h before Fe ions prevented all of the responses to Fe ions,66 which again illustrates how the complex composition and timing of space radiation can impact the level of DNA damage and the cellular response to such insults. Therefore, not only microgravity can impact space radiation-induced DDR, but also the radiation types and sequence and the exposure duration may influence the DDR. In conclusion, carefully designed experiments, perhaps ones implementing a radiation source or other DNA damage agents in space are needed given the conflict results between the reported studies on this topic. Higher levels of DNA damage that is intentionally induced in space would likely be necessary to achieve the results with statistical significance. Meanwhile, experiments using an in-flight 1 g centrifuge compared to the micro-g would provide clues to such questions with damage by natural space radiation levels. However, the assay employed in such studies has to be sensitive enough to detect the DDR to low levels of damage.",

        "Abstract": "The implementation of rotating-wall vessels (RWVs) for studying the effect of lack of gravity has attracted attention, especially in the fields of stem cells, tissue regeneration, and cancer research. Immune cells incubated in RWVs exhibit several features of immunosuppression including impaired leukocyte proliferation, cytokine responses, and antibody production. Interestingly, stress hormones influence cellular immune pathways affected by microgravity, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, DNA repair, and T cell activation. These pathways are crucial defense mechanisms that protect the cell from toxins, pathogens, and radiation. Despite the importance of the adrenergic receptor in regulating the immune system, the effect of microgravity on the adrenergic system has been poorly studied. Thus, we elected to investigate the synergistic effects of isoproterenol (a sympathomimetic drug), radiation, and microgravity in nonstimulated immune cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were treated with the sympathomimetic drug isoproterenol, exposed to 0.8 or 2 Gy \u03b3-radiation, and incubated in RWVs. Mixed model regression analyses showed significant synergistic effects on the expression of the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB2). Radiation alone increased ADRB2 expression, and cells incubated in microgravity had more DNA strand breaks than cells incubated in normal gravity. We observed radiation-induced cytokine production only in microgravity. Prior treatment with isoproterenol clearly prevents most of the microgravity-mediated effects. RWVs may be a useful tool to provide insight into novel regulatory pathways, providing benefit not only to astronauts but also to patients suffering from immune disorders or undergoing radiotherapy.",

        "Abstract": "Tissue preservation is a minimal requirement for the success of plant RNA and protein expression studies. The standard of snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen is not always practical or possible. RNAlater, a concentrated solution of ammonium and cesium sulfates, has become a standard preservative in the absence of liquid nitrogen. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RNAlater in preserving both RNA and proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana tissues for use in RNAseq and LC-MS/MS analysis of proteins. While successful in preserving plant material, a transcriptomic and proteomic response is evident. Specifically, 5770 gene transcripts, 84 soluble proteins, and 120 membrane-bound proteins were found to be differentially expressed at a log-fold change of \u00b11 (P \u2264 0.05). This response is mirrored in the abundance of post-translational modifications, with 23 of the 108 (21.3%) phosphorylated proteins showing altered abundance at a log-fold change of \u00b11 (P \u2264 0.05). While RNAlater is effective in preserving biological information, our findings warrant caution in its use for transcriptomic and proteomic experiments.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundUnderstanding of gravity sensing and response is critical to long-term human habitation in space and can provide new advantages for terrestrial agriculture. To this end, the altered gene expression profile induced by microgravity has been repeatedly queried by microarray and RNA-seq experiments to understand gravitropism. However, the quantification of altered protein abundance in space has been minimally investigated. ResultsProteomic (iTRAQ-labelled LC-MS/MS) and transcriptomic (RNA-seq) analyses simultaneously quantified protein and transcript differential expression of three-day old, etiolated Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings grown aboard the International Space Station along with their ground control counterparts. Protein extracts were fractionated to isolate soluble and membrane proteins and analyzed to detect differentially phosphorylated peptides. In total, 968 RNAs, 107 soluble proteins, and 103 membrane proteins were identified as differentially expressed. In addition, the proteomic analyses identified 16 differential phosphorylation events. Proteomic data delivered novel insights and simultaneously provided new context to previously made observations of gene expression in microgravity. There is a sweeping shift in post-transcriptional mechanisms of gene regulation including RNA-decapping protein DCP5, the splicing factors GRP7 and GRP8, and AGO4,. These data also indicate AHA2 and FERONIA as well as CESA1 and SHOU4 as central to the cell wall adaptations seen in spaceflight. Patterns of tubulin-\u03b1 1, 3,4 and 6 phosphorylation further reveal an interaction of microtubule and redox homeostasis that mirrors osmotic response signaling elements. The absence of gravity also results in a seemingly wasteful dysregulation of plastid gene transcription. ConclusionsThe datasets gathered from Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to microgravity revealed marked impacts on post-transcriptional regulation, cell wall synthesis, redox/microtubule dynamics, and plastid gene transcription. The impact of post-transcriptional regulatory alterations represents an unstudied element of the plant microgravity response with the potential to significantly impact plant growth efficiency and beyond. What\u2019s more, addressing the effects of microgravity on AHA2, CESA1, and alpha tubulins has the potential to enhance cytoskeletal organization and cell wall composition, thereby enhancing biomass production and growth in microgravity. Finally, understanding and manipulating the dysregulation of plastid gene transcription has further potential to address the goal of enhancing plant growth in the stressful conditions of microgravity.",
        "Conclusion": "The unified transcriptomic and proteomic characterization of space-flown Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrate the value in employing various \u2018omics approaches for data acquisition. The regulatory landscape of the cell is difficult to decipher with transcript data alone, such that the addition of proteomic data provides a more complete picture of plant response to spaceflight and microgravity. Ultimately, we have characterized a significant impact of the spaceflight environment on post-transcriptional regulation, redox homeostasis, plastid gene transcription, and cell wall synthesis. While some of these responses to microgravity have been previously studied or observed, the transcriptomic and proteomic studies unified to produce the most comprehensive understanding of these events to date and provide new direction and strategies for plant engineering. The role of CESA1 and AHA2 along with their potential regulation by SHOU4 and FERONIA, respectively, provide novel insights into the decreased cellulose deposition previously observed in spaceflight [20, 21]. In addition, the interface of redox homeostasis and microtubule dynamics provides a relevant physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment that may result in altered oxidative stress while also enhancing the structural integrity cells in the absence of gravity. Altered regulation of specific elements of cell wall synthesis and microtubule stability, along with the production of plastid transcripts, provide three new targets to engineer plants for optimal growth during long-term spaceflight missions. The sweeping alterations to mRNA turnover, silencing, and splicing, as well as initiation/elongation of protein translation, protein turnover, and other aspects of post-transcriptional regulation may raise more questions than answers and necessitates further study. This regulatory shift indicates that questions regarding spaceflight physiology will not be adequately addressed by transcriptomic studies. Finally, we note that phosphoenriched proteomics remain an unmet need to characterize plant response to microgravity and will provide essential insights into the regulatory mechanisms of plant adaptation to space.",

        "Abstract": "With the construction of the International Space Station, humans have been continuously living and working in space for 22 years. Microbial studies in space and other extreme environments on Earth have shown the ability for bacteria and fungi to adapt and change compared to \u201cnormal\u201d conditions. Some of these changes, like biofilm formation, can impact astronaut health and spacecraft integrity in a negative way, while others, such as a propensity for plastic degradation, can promote self-sufficiency and sustainability in space. With the next era of space exploration upon us, which will see crewed missions to the Moon and Mars in the next 10 years, incorporating microbiology research into planning, decision-making, and mission design will be paramount to ensuring success of these long-duration missions. These can include astronaut microbiome studies to protect against infections, immune system dysfunction and bone deterioration, or biological in situ resource utilization (bISRU) studies that incorporate microbes to act as radiation shields, create electricity and establish robust plant habitats for fresh food and recycling of waste. In this review, information will be presented on the beneficial use of microbes in bioregenerative life support systems, their applicability to bISRU, and their capability to be genetically engineered for biotechnological space applications. In addition, we discuss the negative effect microbes and microbial communities may have on long-duration space travel and provide mitigation strategies to reduce their impact. Utilizing the benefits of microbes, while understanding their limitations, will help us explore deeper into space and develop sustainable human habitats on the Moon, Mars and beyond.",

        "Abstract": "Finding sustainable approaches to achieve independence from terrestrial resources is of pivotal importance for the future of space exploration. This is relevant not only to establish viable space exploration beyond low Earth\u2013orbit, but also for ethical considerations associated with the generation of space waste and the preservation of extra-terrestrial environments. Here we propose and highlight a series of microbial biotechnologies uniquely suited to establish sustainable processes for in situ resource utilization and loop-closure. Microbial biotechnologies research and development for space sustainability will be translatable to Earth applications, tackling terrestrial environmental issues, thereby supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.",
        "Conclusion": "With this work, we aimed to advocate the urgency of sustainable approaches for human space exploration, and the essential role microbial biotechnologies could play in this. It has been discussed how microbial biotechnologies may support several processes that, in turn, can help decrease supply chain dependency (from Earth) on long-duration deep-space exploration missions to eventually enable human footholds and settlements across the solar system. In parallel, several of these microbially-supported processes may also help close the loop on LSS and other systems, which can preserve resources and extra-terrestrial environments. These two aspects, independently and together, enable space exploration in a sustainable fashion. To provide appropriate conditions for the maturation of named biotechnologies and to open the field to a wider community, research and innovation are needed. Preliminary studies should be supported in laboratories on Earth, simulation platforms, and in LEO, and full investigations in cis-Lunar space and on the Lunar surface. Augmenting existing space-based facilities to increase the capacity for space experiments, in terms of sample replicates and experimental conditions, should also be considered to improve the impact of the preliminary studies. Funding should take into account the high cost (and time) of genetic engineering and synthetic biology, on which these technologies will likely heavily rely. Finally, the potential of these technologies for terrestrial benefits has been discussed, with specific reference to the United Nation SDGs. If ultra-efficient approaches to sustaining human life and economic activity off-Earth can be adapted towards meaningfully solving problems on our planet, space exploration will have yielded a manifold return on public investments and will thereby become more sustainable not only technologically, but also politically. The debate about the public benefits of space travel and exploration is healthy and necessary, but in the field of sustainability, space advocates may now have an opportunity to win this debate for a generation.",

It was only in the last century that humankind finally began taking significant steps towards these goals by sending astronauts into space, landing on the moon, and building the International Space Station. However, space voyage is very challenging and dangerous, and astronauts are under constant space radiation and microgravity. It has been shown that astronauts are at a high risk of developing a broad range of diseases/disorders. Thus, it is critical to develop a rapid and effective assay to monitor astronauts\u2019 health in space. In this study, gene expression and correlation patterns were analyzed for 10 astronauts (8 male and 2 female) using the publicly available microarray dataset E-GEOD-74708. We identified 218 differentially expressed genes between In-flight and Pre-flight and noticed that space travel decreased genome regulation and gene correlations across the entire genome, as well as individual signaling pathways. Furthermore, we systematically developed a shortlist of 32 genes that could be used to monitor astronauts\u2019 health during space travel. Further studies, including microgravity experiments, are warranted to optimize and validate the proposed assay.",

        "Abstract": "Summary In P. aeruginosa, alginate overproduction, also known as mucoidy, is negatively regulated by the transmembrane protein MucA, which sequesters the alternative sigma factor AlgU. MucA is degraded via a proteolysis pathway that frees AlgU from sequestration, activating alginate biosynthesis. Initiation of this pathway normally requires two signals: peptide sequences in unassembled outer-membrane proteins (OMPs) activate the AlgW protease, and unassembled lipopolysaccharides bind periplasmic MucB, releasing MucA and facilitating its proteolysis by activated AlgW. To search for novel alginate regulators, we screened a transposon library in the non-mucoid reference strain PAO1, and identified a mutant that confers mucoidy through overexpression of a protein encoded by the chaperone-usher pathway gene cupB5. CupB5-dependent mucoidy occurs through the AlgU pathway and can be reversed by overexpression of MucA or MucB. In the presence of activating OMP peptides, peptides corresponding to a region of CupB5 needed for mucoidy further stimulated AlgW cleavage of MucA in vitro. Moreover, the CupB5 peptide allowed OMP-activated AlgW cleavage of MucA in the presence of the MucB inhibitor. These results support a novel mechanism for conversion to mucoidy in which the proteolytic activity of AlgW and its ability to compete with MucB for MucA is mediated by independent peptide signals.",

        "Abstract": "Abstract It is theorized that toxic agents are transported from the hyperpermeable gut of burn victims through the lymph, to the systemic circulation, causing global injury. We believe that immune cells respond to leakage of \u201ctoxic lymph\u201d following trauma causing the attraction of these cells to the perilymphatic space. To test this, we utilized a model of burn on rats to examine changes in a single immune cell population associated with mesenteric lymphatic dysfunction. We examined the ability of serum from these animals to increase permeability in lymphatic endothelial monolayers and disrupt cellular junctions. We also treated burn animals with doxycycline, an inhibitor of microvascular permeability, and observed the effects on immune cell populations, morphometry, and lymphatic endothelial permeability. Burn injury increased the number of MHCII+ immune cells along the vessel (>50%). The size and shape of these cells also changed significantly following burn injury. Serum from burn animals increased lymphatic endothelial permeability (\u223c1.5-fold) and induced breaks in VE-cadherin staining. Doxycycline treatment blocked the accumulation of immune cells along the vessel, whereas serum from doxycycline-treated animals failed to increase lymphatic endothelial permeability. The size of cells along the vessel in doxycycline-treated burn animals was not affected, suggesting that the cells already present on the lymphatic vessels still respond to substances in the lymph. These findings suggest that factors produced during burn can induce lymphatic endothelial barrier disruption and lymph produced during traumatic injury can influence the attraction and morphology of immune cell populations along the vessel.",

        "Abstract": "Space experiments are a technically challenging but a scientifically important part of astrobiology and astrochemistry research. The International Space Station (ISS) is an excellent example of a highly successful and long-lasting research platform for experiments in space, that has provided a wealth of scientific data over the last two decades. However, future space platforms present new opportunities to conduct experiments with the potential to address key topics in astrobiology and astrochemistry. In this perspective, the European Space Agency (ESA) Topical Team Astrobiology and Astrochemistry (with feedback from the wider scientific community) identifies a number of key topics and summarizes the 2021 \u201cESA SciSpacE Science Community White Paper\u201d for astrobiology and astrochemistry. We highlight recommendations for the development and implementation of future experiments, discuss types of in situ measurements, experimental parameters, exposure scenarios and orbits, and identify knowledge gaps and how to advance scientific utilization of future space-exposure platforms that are either currently under development or in an advanced planning stage. In addition to the ISS, these platforms include CubeSats and SmallSats, as well as larger platforms such as the Lunar Orbital Gateway. We also provide an outlook for in situ experiments on the Moon and Mars, and welcome new possibilities to support the search for exoplanets and potential biosignatures within and beyond our solar system.",

An Earth-based approach was designed and implemented using inclined clinostats and an in-house-developed code to determine the optimal clinorotation angular speed for bacterial liquid cultures of 5 RPM. With this setup, growth dynamics, phenotypic changes, and sensitivity to antibiotics (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of two different classes of antibiotics) for three Escherichia coli strains (including uropathogenic) were examined under simulated micro-, lunar, and Martian gravities. The results included increased growth under simulated micro- and lunar gravities for some strains, and higher concentrations of antibiotics needed under simulated lunar gravity with respect to simulated micro- and Martian gravities. Clinostat-produced results can be considered suggestive but not determinative of what might be expected in altered gravity, as there is still a need to systematically verify these simulation devices\u2019 ability to accurately replicate phenomena observed in space. Nevertheless, this approach serves as a baseline to start interrogating key cellular and molecular aspects relevant to microbial processes on the lunar and Martian surfaces.",

To mitigate the risks that arise from them, it is important to understand biofilms\u2019 behavior in microgravity. As part of the Space Biofilms project, biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were grown in spaceflight over material surfaces. Stainless Steel 316 (SS316) and passivated SS316 were tested for their relevance as spaceflight hardware components, while a lubricant impregnated surface (LIS) was tested as potential biofilm control strategy. The morphology and gene expression of biofilms were characterized. Biofilms in microgravity are less robust than on Earth. LIS strongly inhibits biofilm formation compared to SS. Furthermore, this effect is even greater in spaceflight than on Earth, making LIS a promising option for spacecraft use. Transcriptomic profiles for the different conditions are presented, and potential mechanisms of biofilm reduction on LIS are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "A biological life support system for spaceflight would capture carbon dioxide waste produced by living and working in space to generate useful organic compounds. Photosynthesis is the primary mechanism to fix carbon into organic molecules. Microalgae are highly efficient at converting light, water, and carbon dioxide into biomass, particularly under limiting, artificial light conditions that are a necessity in space photosynthetic production. Although there is great promise in developing algae for chemical or food production in space, most spaceflight algae growth studies have been conducted on solid agar-media to avoid handling liquids in microgravity. Here we report that breathable plastic tissue culture bags can support robust growth of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in the Veggie plant growth chamber, which is used on the International Space Station (ISS) to grow terrestrial plants. Live cultures can be stored for at least 1 month in the bags at room temperature. The gene set required for growth in these photobioreactors was tested using a competitive growth assay with mutations induced by short-wave ultraviolet light (UVC) mutagenesis in either wild-type (CC-5082) or cw15 mutant (CC-1883) strains at the start of the assay. Genome sequencing identified UVC-induced mutations, which were enriched for transversions and non-synonymous mutations relative to natural variants among laboratory strains. Genes with mutations indicating positive selection were enriched for information processing genes related to DNA repair, RNA processing, translation, cytoskeletal motors, kinases, and ABC transporters. These data suggest that modification of DNA repair, signal transduction, and metabolite transport may be needed to improve growth rates in this spaceflight production system.",

Three technology demonstrations were completed achieving simultaneous multi-species plant growth and the concurrent use of two Veggie units on the International Space Station (ISS). Microbiological characterization using molecular and culture-based methods was performed on leaves and roots from two harvests of three leafy greens, red romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. \u2018Outredgeous\u2019); mizuna mustard, (Brassica rapa var japonica); and green leaf lettuce, (Lactuca sativa cv. Waldmann\u2019s) and associated rooting pillow components and Veggie chamber surfaces. Culture based enumeration and pathogen screening indicated the leafy greens were safe for consumption. Surface samples of the Veggie facility and plant pillows revealed low counts of bacteria and fungi and are commonly isolated on ISS. Community analysis was completed with 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Comparisons between pillow components, and plant tissue types from VEG-03D, E, and F revealed higher diversity in roots and rooting substrate than the leaves and wick. This work provides valuable information for food production-related research on the ISS and the impact of the plant microbiome on this unique closed environment.",

        "Abstract": "One of the major concerns for long-term exploration missions beyond the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere is consequences from exposures to solar particle event (SPE) protons and galactic cosmic rays (GCR). For long-term crewed Lunar and Mars explorations, the production of fresh food in space will provide both nutritional supplements and psychological benefits to the astronauts. However, the effects of space radiation on plants and plant propagules have not been sufficiently investigated and characterized. In this study, we evaluated the effect of two different compositions of charged particles-simulated GCR, and simulated SPE protons on dry and hydrated seeds of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the crop plant Mizuna mustard [Brassica rapa var. japonica]. Exposures to charged particles, simulated GCRs (up to 80 cGy) or SPEs (up to 200 cGy), were performed either acutely or at a low dose rate using the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) facility at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL). Control and irradiated seeds were planted in a solid phytogel and grown in a controlled environment. Five to seven days after planting, morphological parameters were measured to evaluate radiation-induced damage in the seedlings. After exposure to single types of charged particles, as well as to simulated GCR, the hydrated Arabidopsis seeds showed dose- and quality-dependent responses, with heavier ions causing more severe defects. Seeds exposed to simulated GCR (dry seeds) and SPE (hydrated seeds) had significant, although much less damage than seeds exposed to heavier and higher linear energy transfer (LET) particles. In general, the extent of damage depends on the seed type.",

Methods and resultsWe present a metagenomic analysis of the Gowanus Canal sediment, consisting of a longitudinal study of surface sediment and a depth-based study of sediment core samples. We demonstrate that the resident microbiome includes 455 species, including extremophiles across a range of saltwater and freshwater species, which collectively encode 64 metabolic pathways related to organic contaminant degradation and 1171 genes related to heavy metal utilization and detoxification. Furthermore, our genetic screening reveals an environmental reservoir of antimicrobial resistance markers falling within 8 different classes of resistance, as well as de-novo characterization of 2319 biosynthetic gene clusters and diverse groups of secondary metabolites with biomining potential. ConclusionThe microbiome of the Gowanus Canal is a biotechnological resource of novel metabolic functions that could aid in efforts for bioremediation, AMR reservoir mapping, and heavy metal mitigation.",
        "Conclusion": "Once an ecologically diverse estuary and home to the Lenni-Lenape people, the Gowanus Creek was dredged in 1853 as part of ongoing colonial and industrial disruption to the land to become the Gowanus Canal. Its environment today is emblematic of the many post-industrial Superfund sites across the country. Like Gowanus, many of these locations were important sites for production and manufacturing industries that have now moved elsewhere leaving a material, economic, and social legacy of toxicity not only in the canal itself but also the surrounding areas As a result of the EPA\u2019s remediation proposals (U.S. EPA 2012), the communities surrounding the Gowanus Canal (notably, those historically disproportionately affected by the contaminated environment) are now vulnerable to residential displacement, and deepening economic inequality (Krisel 2015) in addition to ongoing possible toxic exposure. The Gowanus Canal is considered a forsaken environment from our human perspective: the Superfund cleanup plan is to dredge the canal and cap it with an impermeable layer. Yet, this study shows that this environment is thriving from a microbial perspective. These microbes have evolved to survive harsh conditions, and have shown capability of not only remediate contaminants in the environment, but also produce novel SMs. These data show there is still much we can learn from these lifeforms who have evolved to inhabit industrial ruins. At a time where human disturbance has become a geological force, these results further suggest that we should redefine our relationship to the lifeforms we live amongst, with a responsibility for stewardship and reciprocity. These microscopic neighbors not only serve as a genetic catalog of bioremediation functions, but open our imagination to new modes of what theorist Anna Tsing calls \u201ccollaborative survival\u201d\u2014of ways to live together on a damaged planet (Tsing 2015).",

        "Abstract": "Over the past 30 years, organs-on-a-chip (OOCs) have emerged as a robust alternative to address the technological challenges associated with current in vitro and in vivo options. Although OOCs offer improved bio-relevance and controlled complexity, broad adoption has remained limited. Most approaches to characterize on-chip structure and function require human intervention, limiting device translation and feasibility. Here, we introduce a new fiber optic-based sensing platform that enables automated, temporal luminescence sensing on-chip, validated for real-time readout of epithelial and endothelial barrier function under cytokine-induced inflammation. Our platform, capable of at least 1 \u03bcM resolution, tracked paracellular transport in situ for 9 days of culture under perfusion on-chip. These results offer an alternative sensing approach for continuous, non-invasive luminescence monitoring in OOCs.",
        "Conclusion": "In summary, we have developed a novel optical sensing platform for automated, non-invasive barrier function measurements in OOCs. The platform has been validated for sensing small changes in barrier integrity in real-time, improving on the current standard of effluent sampling and analysis or TEER measurements. Our platform does not interact directly with the on-chip sample, offering advantages over integrated electrochemical sensors susceptible to electrode fouling or site saturation. We have demonstrated that, by exchanging optical filters and dichroic mirrors, luminescence across the visible wavelength range may be measured. Further, the system may be utilized for multiplexed sensing of multiple fluorophores simultaneously, broadening applications to size- and process-specific transport across barriers.",

        "Abstract": "Exposure to weightlessness in microgravity and elevated space radiation are associated with rapid bone loss in mammals, but questions remain about their mechanisms of action and relative importance. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that bone loss during spaceflight in Low Earth Orbit is primarily associated with site-specific microgravity unloading of weight-bearing sites in the skeleton. Microcomputed tomography and histological analyses of bones from mice space flown on ISS for 37 days in the NASA Rodent Research-1 experiment show significant site-specific cancellous and cortical bone loss occurring in the femur, but not in L2 vertebrae. The lack of bone degenerative effects in the spine in combination with same-animal paired losses in the femur suggests that space radiation levels in Low Earth Orbit or other systemic stresses are not likely to significantly contribute to the observed bone loss. Remarkably, spaceflight is also associated with accelerated progression of femoral head endochondral ossification. This suggests the microgravity environment promotes premature progression of secondary ossification during late stages of skeletal maturation at 21 weeks. Furthermore, mice housed in the NASA ISS Rodent Habitat during 1g ground controls maintained or gained bone relative to mice housed in standard vivarium cages that showed significant bone mass declines. These findings suggest that housing in the Rodent Habitat with greater topological enrichment from 3D wire-mesh surfaces may promote increased mechanical loading of weight-bearing bones and maintenance of bone mass. In summary, our results indicate that in female mice approaching skeletal maturity, mechanical unloading of weight-bearing sites is the major cause of bone loss in microgravity, while sites loaded predominantly by muscle activity, such as the spine, appear unaffected. Additionally, we identified early-onset of femoral head epiphyseal plate secondary ossification as a novel spaceflight skeletal unloading effect that may lead to premature long bone growth arrest in microgravity.",

        "Abstract": "Space flight exposes astronauts to stressors that alter the immune response, rendering them vulnerable to infections and diseases. In this study, we aimed to determine the levels of inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the International Space Station (ISS) for 37 days. C57BL/6 mice were launched to the ISS as part of NASA\u2019s Rodent Research 1 Mission on SpaceX-4 CRS-4 Dragon cargo spacecraft from 21 September 2014 to 25 October 2014. Dissected mouse brains from that mission were analyzed by immunoblotting of inflammasome signaling proteins and Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay (ECLIA) for inflammatory cytokine levels. Our data indicate decreased inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the ISS for 37 days when compared to the brains of mice that were maintained on the ground, and in mice corresponding to the baseline group that were sacrificed at the time of launching of SpaceX-4. Moreover, we did not detect any significant changes in the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12p70 and IL-10 between the ground control and the flight groups. Together, these studies suggest that spaceflight results in a decrease in the levels of innate immune signaling molecules that govern inflammasome signaling in the brain of mice.",

        "Abstract": "Space travel is a growing area of interest and includes initiatives such as NASA\u2019s Moon-to-Mars Mission. Reports on the cardiovascular effects of space travel reveal changes in morphology, metabolism, and function of the cardiovascular system. In this study, the cardiovascular response to immunization in space was studied in mice which were housed and immunized while on the International Space Station (ISS). Mice were immunized with tetanus toxoid combined with the adjuvant CpG (TT + CpG) and the effects of vaccination in space were studied using transcriptomics. Analysis of the mouse heart transcriptome was performed on flight control and flight-immunized mice. The results show that immunization aboard the ISS stimulates heightened inflammation in the heart via induction of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway to promote the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN\u03b3, IL-17 and IL-6. Additional transcriptomic changes included alterations in the cytoskeleton and in the expression of transcripts associated with protection from oxidative stress. In summary, inflammation in the heart can occur following immunization in space. This investigation explores the impact of immune challenges on the heart and lays the groundwork for future research into additional cardiac alterations which can occur during spaceflight.

        "Conclusion": "A 30-day exposure to the spaceflight environment, combined with immunological events, such as vaccination or exposure to a pathogen, can induce inflammation and cytoskeletal remodeling in the mouse heart. Protective transcripts are induced in the heart, which reduce oxidative stress associated with inflammatory responses and prevent cardiomyocyte loss. This report lends insight into the cardiovascular response to immune challenges in space and provides a foundation for future studies designed to elucidate whether inflammation in the heart is a transient or chronic effect following vaccination in the spaceflight environment.",

        "Abstract": "Spaceflight has several detrimental effects on human and rodent health. For example, liver dysfunction is a common phenotype observed in space-flown rodents, and this dysfunction is partially reflected in transcriptomic changes. Studies linking transcriptomics with liver dysfunction rely on tools which exploit correlation, but these tools make no attempt to disambiguate true correlations from spurious ones. In this work, we use a machine learning ensemble of causal inference methods called the Causal Research and Inference Search Platform (CRISP) which was developed to predict causal features of a binary response variable from high-dimensional input. We used CRISP to identify genes robustly correlated with a lipid density phenotype using transcriptomic and histological data from the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR). Our approach identified genes and molecular targets not predicted by previous traditional differential gene expression analyses. These genes are likely to play a pivotal role in the liver dysfunction observed in space-flown rodents, and this work opens the door to identifying novel countermeasures for space travel.",

        "Abstract": "Men and women have different cardiovascular responses to spaceflight; however, few studies have focused on direct comparisons between sexes. We investigated the mechanisms of aortic stiffening in socially and sexually mature 20-week-old male and female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats exposed to hindlimb unloading (HLU) for 14 days. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was greater in the aortic arch of females after HLU versus control females (n = 6\u20138). HLU had no effect on aortic PWV in males (n = 5\u20136). Aortic \u03b1 smooth muscle actin, myosin, collagen, elastin, and collagen-to-elastin ratio were not different in rats of either sex following HLU. The levels of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) were lower in the aorta of SD females exposed to HLU compared with female controls but were not altered in males. HLU females also had lower aortic PPAR\u03b3, increased oxidative stress markers, and diastolic dysfunction compared with control females. GPER agonist G1 prevented the increase in PWV and 8-hydroxy-2\u2019-deoxyguanosine without altering PPAR\u03b3 or p47phox in HLU females (n = 4 in each group) suggesting that lower GPER may contribute to arterial stiffening in the setting of simulated microgravity. This study highlights sex-specific vascular adaptations to the state of simulated microgravity.",

The use of centrifugation to exert forces that partially or fully mimic Earth-level gravity in space is a possible countermeasure to mitigate the effects of microgravity on the eye. Therefore, we subjected mice on the International Space Station (ISS) to microgravity (0 G) or artificial gravity by centrifugation at 0.33 G, 0.67 G, and 1 G, and then performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on optic nerve and retinal tissue after returning them to Earth alive. We find that the microgravity environment induces transcriptomic changes in the optic nerve and retina consistent with an increased oxidative stress load, inflammation, apoptosis, and lipid metabolic stress. We also find that adding artificial gravity on board the ISS attenuates the transcriptomic response to microgravity in a dose-dependent manner. Such attenuation may effectively protect from and mitigate spaceflight-induced detrimental effects on ocular tissue.",

        "Abstract": "Human exploration of the solar system will expose crew members to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), with a potential for adverse health effects. GCR particles (protons and ions) move at nearly the speed of light and easily penetrate space station walls, as well as the human body. Previously, we have shown reactivation of latent herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus, Varicella zoster virus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV), during stays at the International Space Station. Given the prevalence of latent CMV and the known propensity of space radiation to cause alterations in many cellular processes, we undertook this study to understand the role of GCR in reactivating latent CMV. Latently infected Kasumi cells with CMV were irradiated with 137Cs gamma rays, 150 MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, 600 MeV/n iron ions, proton ions, and simulated GCR. The CMV copy number increased significantly in the cells exposed to radiation as compared with the non-irradiated controls. Viral genome sequencing did not reveal significant nucleotide differences among the compared groups. However, transcriptome analysis showed the upregulation of transcription of the UL49 ORF, implicating it in the switch from latent to lytic replication. These findings support our hypothesis that GCR may be a strong contributor to the reactivation of CMV infection seen in ISS crew members.",

UNC-89 contains two protein kinase domains, PK1 and PK2, separated by an elastic region. Here we show that PK2 is a canonical kinase expected to be catalytically active. C. elegans expressing UNC-89 with a lysine to alanine (KtoA) mutation to inactivate PK2 have normally organized sarcomeres and SR, and normal muscle function. PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented mitochondria, correlated with more mitochondrially-associated DRP-1. PK2 KtoA mutants have increased ATP levels, increased glycolysis and altered levels of electron transport chain complexes. Muscle mitochondria show increased complex I and decreased complex II basal respiration, each of which cannot be uncoupled. This suggests that mutant mitochondria are already uncoupled, possibly resulting from an increased level of the uncoupling protein, UCP-4. Our results suggest signaling from sarcomeres to mitochondria, to help match energy requirements with energy production.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundThe extreme environment of the International Space Station (ISS) puts selective pressure on microorganisms unintentionally introduced during its 20+ years of service as a low-orbit science platform and human habitat. Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions. ResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool\u2014deepFRI\u2014we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity. ConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.

        "Abstract": "BackgroundThe commercialization of space travel will soon lead to many more people living and working in unique built environments similar to the International Space Station, which is a specialized closed environment that contains its own indoor microbiome. Unintended microbial growth can occur in these environments as in buildings on Earth from elevated moisture, such as from a temporary ventilation system failure. This growth can drive negative health outcomes and degrade building materials. We need a predictive approach for modeling microbial growth in these critical indoor spaces. ResultsHere, we demonstrate that even short exposures to varying elevated relative humidity can facilitate rapid microbial growth and microbial community composition changes in dust from spacecraft. We modeled fungal growth in dust from the International Space Station using the time-of-wetness framework with activation and deactivation limited growth occurring at 85% and 100% relative humidity, respectively. Fungal concentrations ranged from an average of 4.4 \u00d7 106 spore equivalents per milligram of dust in original dust with no exposure to relative humidity to up to 2.1 \u00d7 1010 when exposed to 100% relative humidity for 2 weeks. As relative humidity and time-elevated increased, fungal diversity was significantly reduced for both alpha (Q < 0.05) and beta (R2 = 0.307, P = 0.001) diversity metrics. Bacteria were unable to be modeled using the time-of-wetness framework. However, bacterial communities did change based on constant relative humidity incubations for both beta (R2 = 0.22, P = 0.001) and alpha diversity decreasing with increasing moisture starting at 85% relative humidity (Q < 0.05). ConclusionOur results demonstrate that moisture conditions can be used to develop and predict changes in fungal growth and composition onboard human-occupied spacecraft. This predictive model can be expanded upon to include other spacecraft environmental factors such as microgravity, elevated carbon dioxide conditions, and radiation exposure. Understanding microbial growth in spacecraft can help better protect astronaut health, fortify spacecraft integrity, and promote planetary protection as human activity increases in low-Earth orbit, the moon, Mars, and beyond. Video Abstract Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40168-024-01864-3.",
        "Conclusion": "Our results provide important foundational knowledge for the prediction of fungal growth in future spacecraft, space stations, and surface habitats. The time-of-wetness framework, which utilizes varying ERH conditions, as shown in this study can be expanded and refined to incorporate other key environmental factors present in spaceflight. With the appropriate model based on time exposure to elevated relative humidity levels, we can predict how much and what type of microbial growth will be present in spacecraft dust during long-duration human space missions. We can continue to refine moisture control on spacecraft to preserve a healthy environment. As crewed commercial spacecraft and missions beyond low-Earth orbit become a reality, a better understanding of microbes onboard a spacecraft will protect human health and spacecraft integrity and aid in developing planetary protection protocols to prevent forward and/or backward microbial contamination of Earth and the other celestial bodies we will visit in the future [61].",

        "Abstract": "The ISS rodent habitat has provided crucial insights into the impact of spaceflight on mammals, inducing symptoms characteristic of liver disease, insulin resistance, osteopenia, and myopathy. Although these physiological responses can involve the microbiome on Earth, host-microbiota interactions during spaceflight are still being elucidated. We explore murine gut microbiota and host gene expression in the colon and liver after 29 and 56 days of spaceflight using multiomics. Metagenomics revealed significant changes in 44 microbiome species, including relative reductions in bile acid and butyrate metabolising bacteria like Extibacter muris and Dysosmobacter welbionis. Functional prediction indicate over-representation of fatty acid and bile acid metabolism, extracellular matrix interactions, and antibiotic resistance genes. Host gene expression described corresponding changes to bile acid and energy metabolism, and immune suppression. These changes imply that interactions at the host-gut microbiome interface contribute to spaceflight pathology and that these interactions might critically influence human health and long-duration spaceflight feasibility.",
        "Conclusion": "Through metagenomic assessment of the murine gut microbiome, significant spaceflight-associated changes in bacteria linked to bile and fatty acid metabolism were identified. These changes in relative abundance were largely consistent in two groups of mice after spaceflight when compared to different on-Earth control groups at different timepoints as well as when using distinct metagenomic methodologies. The microbiome changes coincided with substantial changes to gene expression at the host-gut microbiome interface which are critical to barrier function, microbe interactions and bile acid transport in the intestine. These interactions suggest disruption of the signals, metabolites, and immune factors exchanged across the gut-liver axis which are likely to drive glucose and lipid dysregulation. Collectively, these multiomic findings suggest host-gut microbiome interactions during spaceflight are likely to underly widespread changes to host physiology which could pose a risk to health.",

Because of the potential for increased cancer risk from astronaut exposure to space radiation, we determined whether microgravity present during spaceflight affects the body\u2019s defenses against leukemogenesis. Human NK cells were cultured for 48 h under normal gravity and simulated microgravity (s\u03bcG), and cytotoxicity against K-562 (CML) and MOLT-4 (T-ALL) cells was measured using standard methodology or under continuous s\u03bcG. This brief exposure to s\u03bcG markedly reduced NK cytotoxicity against both leukemias, and these deleterious effects were more pronounced in continuous s\u03bcG. RNA-seq performed on NK cells from two additional healthy donors provided insight into the mechanism(s) by which s\u03bcG reduced cytotoxicity. Given our prior report of space radiation-induced human T-ALL in vivo, the reduced cytotoxicity against MOLT-4 is striking and raises the possibility that \u03bcG may increase astronaut risk of leukemogenesis during prolonged missions beyond LEO.",

        "Abstract": "Microgravity exposure induces a cephalad fluid shift and an overall reduction in physical activity levels which can lead to cardiovascular deconditioning in the absence of countermeasures. Future spaceflight missions will expose crew to extended periods of microgravity among other stressors, the effects of which on cardiovascular health are not fully known. In this study, we determined cardiac responses to extended microgravity exposure using the rat hindlimb unloading (HU) model. We hypothesized that exposure to prolonged simulated microgravity and subsequent recovery would lead to increased oxidative damage and altered expression of genes involved in the oxidative response. To test this hypothesis, we examined hearts of male (three and nine months of age) and female (3 months of age) Long\u2013Evans rats that underwent HU for various durations up to 90 days and reambulated up to 90 days post-HU. Results indicate sex-dependent changes in oxidative damage marker 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and antioxidant gene expression in left ventricular tissue. Three-month-old females displayed elevated 8-OHdG levels after 14 days of HU while age-matched males did not. In nine-month-old males, there were no differences in 8-OHdG levels between HU and normally loaded control males at any of the timepoints tested following HU. RNAseq analysis of left ventricular tissue from nine-month-old males after 14 days of HU revealed upregulation of pathways involved in pro-inflammatory signaling, immune cell activation and differential expression of genes associated with cardiovascular disease progression. Taken together, these findings provide a rationale for targeting antioxidant and immune pathways and that sex differences should be taken into account in the development of countermeasures to maintain cardiovascular health in space.",

        "Abstract": "Spending time in a microgravity environment is known to cause significant skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness via muscle unloading, which can be partly attributed to Ca2+ dysregulation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump is responsible for bringing Ca2+ from the cytosol into its storage site, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), at the expense of ATP. We have recently demonstrated that, in the soleus of space-flown mice, the Ca2+ uptake ability of the SERCA pump is severely impaired and this may be attributed to increases in reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS), to which SERCA is highly susceptible. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with the antioxidant, Manganese(III) meso-tetrakis(N-n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ (BuOE), could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction. We received soleus muscles from the rodent research 18 mission which had male mice housed on the international space station for 35 days and treated with either saline or BuOE. Spaceflight significantly reduced the soleus:body mass ratio and significantly increased SERCA\u2019s ionophore ratio, a measure of SR Ca2+ leak, and 4-HNE content (marker of RONS), none of which could be rescued by BuOE treatment. In conclusion, we find that spaceflight induces significant soleus muscle atrophy and SR Ca2+ leak that cannot be counteracted with BuOE treatment. Future work should investigate alternative therapeutics that are specifically aimed at increasing SERCA activation or reducing Ca2+ leak.",
